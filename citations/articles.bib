  abstract={Character strengths-based interventions are effective for increasing well-being. However, whether such interventions also change character strengths has never been tested. In Study 1, we studied the effects of seven different variants of character strengths-based interventions on well-being, ill-being, and character strengths traits and states (i.e., frequency of behavior during one week). We analyzed data of N = 1,163 participants (82.3% women, aged 18 to 78; Md = 45) who were randomized to seven intervention conditions lasting one week; (1) learning about the VIA classification of character strengths, (2) learning about one's own strengths, using signature strengths (3) in a new way, (4) with a minor challenge, (5) with a larger challenge, (6) for other people, (7) forming a strengths-based habit, or a placebo control condition (early memories). Results showed that using signature strengths in a new way led to increased well-being, social well-being, as well as character strengths states and traits. Forming a strengths-based habit also increased well-being and character strengths states. No effects on ill-being were found. In Study 2, we tested a four-week multi-component program that combined several interventions tested in Study 1 in a sample of N = 254 participants (77.8% women, aged 19 to 87; Md = 42). Compared to a waitlist control group, the intervention condition showed increases in well-being and character strengths states, and reductions in stress and neuroticism. We conclude that character strengths interventions may not only affect well-being but also character strengths states and traits, as well as broader personality traits such as neuroticism.},

  abstract={Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can negatively affect mental health, whereas character strengths seem to be positively correlated with mental health. Detailed information on the history of ACEs among university students in China and the extent which mental health is associated with ACEs and character strengths can contribute to the needed empirical evidence for relevant stakeholders. Objectives of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of ACEs among undergraduate students in Southern China; and 2) to assess the extent which mental health outcomes (positive growth, well-being, and depression) are associated with ACEs and character strengths among undergraduate students in Southern China. We conducted a selfadministered survey among first and second-year students at a university in Southern China and analyzed data using descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses. Among the 779 students who completed the questionnaire, 283 were males, 439 were females, and 57 did not indicate their gender. The prevalence of ACEs among the participants was 32.1%. History of ACEs was associated with lower positive growth score (Adjusted Beta = -0.20; 95% CI = -0.37, -0.02; p = 0.030) and lower well-being score (Adjusted Beta = -1.13; 95% CI = -2.04, -0.23; p = 0.014). Vitality domain of character strength was associated with all three mental health outcomes after adjusting for covariables (all p-values < 0.001). Our study findings provide empirical evidence for stakeholders in university mental health. However, caveats regarding lack of temporality, selection bias, social desirability bias, and lack of generalizability should be considered in the interpretation of the study findings.},

  abstract={Background and Aims: Indian women from lower socioeconomic statuses battle severe hardships owing to various social, cultural, and economic reasons. They have limited opportunities for personal growth, development, and progress in life which adversely affects their well-being and mental health. According to the positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment (PERMA), theory of well-being, utilizing one's inner potential or signature strengths leads to an increase in these five factors of well-being. The present study was to test the effect of signature strengths intervention on well-being and its factors of low-income Indian emerging adult women. Methods: The researcher conducted a 6-weeks long online signature strengths intervention in a sample of 82 economically backward Indian emerging adult women. The study implemented a randomized controlled trial using a pretest-posttest experimental design, measuring well-being and its five factors at the pretest, posttest, and 1-month follow-up. Data were collected using the PERMA Profiler, a standardized questionnaire measuring the five factors of well-being as conceptualized by the PERMA Theory. Results: Findings showed significant increases in well-being and four of its factors, namely, positive emotions, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment factors of well-being at the 1-month follow-up in addition to overall well-being. Conclusion: Results of the study yielded preliminary empirical support for the PERMA Theory of Well-being and revealed that utilizing signature strengths is an effective means to improve different elements of well-being by helping individuals function at their best and live fulfilling lives.},

  abstract={PurposeNursing students encounter a combination of academic rigor, clinical demands and emotional hurdles. Juggling coursework, practical training and patient interaction can be stressful, and exposure to such situations may impact their psychological well-being. This study aims to highlight the top strengths among nursing students and identify the strengths associated with well-being.Design/methodology/approachConvenience sampling was used to select a sample of 150 nursing students studying in first, second and third year from colleges of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Students were administered the Values In Action character strengths inventory, the satisfaction with life scale and scale of positive and negative experience. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation.FindingsResults show that among nursing students, kindness emerged as the foremost strength with the highest mean, followed by honesty, creativity, spirituality and teamwork, and the strengths of curiosity, gratitude, perseverance, self-regulation, social intelligence, and zest were positively associated with life satisfaction and positive emotions and negatively related to negative emotions.Research limitations/implicationsThe small sample size was a limitation; however, this study has been conducted at different locations to improve generalizability.Practical implicationsThis study has profound implications for nursing students, both in their personal development and their future roles as health-care professionals, as fostering these attributes can contribute to the students' growth, well-being and effectiveness as compassionate and competent caregivers. Working on strengths is associated with well-being; therefore, using strengths identified by this study will have a beneficial effect on the students' well-being.Social implicationsCuriosity and social intelligence, for instance, can help nurses better understand patient needs and emotions, developing strengths like perseverance and self-regulation can equip nursing students with tools to cope effectively with the challenges inherent in health-care settings. Traits such as gratitude and social intelligence can enhance communication and empathy which are vital skills for establishing rapport with patients and their families. Emphasizing teamwork as a strength aligns with the collaborative nature of health care. By embodying values like kindness and spirituality, nursing students can create a more compassionate and meaningful experience for patients, as well as themselves.Originality/valueThe research paper identifies and emphasizes the five character strengths that are most commonly observed in a sample of Indian nursing students. In addition, this study delves deeper into these identified strengths to understand how they relate to the overall well-being of nursing students within this specific population. The existing literature has not explored it exhaustively.},

  abstract={ObjectivesPlayfulness describes individual differences in (re)framing situations in a way that they are experienced as interesting, intellectually stimulating, or entertaining. We extended the study of playfulness to groups of middle- and higher age and examined the relations of four facets of playfulness (Other-directed, Lighthearted, Intellectual, and Whimsical) to indicators of positive psychological functioning.MethodWe collected self-report data from 210 participants aged between 50 and 98 years.ResultsThe playfulness expressions in this age group were comparable to younger adults. We found that playfulness relates to life satisfaction, the PERMA domains of well-being, and character strengths with small-to-medium correlation effect sizes. The OLIW facets showed differential associations, with regression analyses revealing that particularly Other-directed is positively associated with positive psychological functioning.ConclusionOur findings highlight the importance of playful relationships across the lifespan. We discuss the findings regarding the role of playfulness for healthy aging.},

  abstract={The meaning in life (MIL) in adolescence is crucial in the developmental process of life. Anchored in the Integrated Model of Meaning Making and the Dual-Systems Model of Meaning, the present study aimed to explore the MIL profiles among Chinese rural adolescents and their characteristics, as well as the role of depression, well-being, character strengths, and academic encouragement in differentiating the MIL profiles. A sample of 579 adolescents from rural China (Mean age = 15.33, SD = 1.69, aged from 12 to 19, female = 56.47%) participated in the survey. Latent profile analysis examined six dimensions of MIL: search for meaning, presence of meaning, need for meaning, meaning confusion, meaning anxiety, and meaning avoidance. Four profiles with different meaning characteristics were revealed: Meaning Oriented profile (18.48%), Bewildered profile (17.62%), Perfunctory profile (51.47%), and Indifferent profile (12.44%). The Meaning Oriented profile had the highest well-being scores and the lowest depression scores compared to the other three profiles. Adolescents with higher character strengths or academic encouragement were less likely to be in the other three profiles than in the Meaning-Oriented profile. The current findings suggest the need for targeted intervention strategies for adolescents with different MIL profiles.},

  abstract={Positive psychological therapy has been found to be effective in psychological health in the broader cancer patient population. However, specific evidence regarding its effectiveness for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients remains limited. More research is needed to determine the optimal approaches for alleviating distress in this particular group. We evaluated the efficacy of character strength-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CS-CBT) versus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for distress in AYA patients with cancer. In a randomized controlled three-arm trial, cancer patients aged 15-39 years were assigned to one of three groups using a random number table to ensure equal group sizes: (1) CS-CBT, which incorporated specific exercises focused on identifying and utilizing character strengths within the CBT framework; (2) CBT; or (3) control group. The primary outcome was improvement in patients' overall mental health on the Distress Thermometer and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 3 months after assignment to the groups. Analyses used generalized estimating equations. A total of 162 AYAs were randomly and equally assigned to three groups. Improvements in primary outcomes were significantly greater after CS-CBT than after CBT, and no significant differences were found between the CBT and control group. Among all primary and secondary outcomes, the only non-significant difference found was in quality of life with CS-CBT compared to CBT. AYA cancer patients rated their overall mental health and sense of thriving as more improved after CS-CBT than after CBT. However, quality-of-life indicators supported equal intervention effects in both groups. These findings support the effectiveness of the use of CS-CBT intervention in reducing distress and improving thriving.},

  abstract={Background and objectives: Depression exerts significant negative impacts across various life domains, including social interactions, occupational functioning, and economic well-being. These effects permeate both personal and interpersonal spheres. However, it seems that character strengths, time perspective, and self-awareness play a critical role in promoting mental well-being. The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of positivity training on character strengths, time perspective, and self-awareness in depressed women. Method: Purposive sampling was employed to select 50 participants with depression based on the cut-off point (a score of 20 or greater) in Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II). They were then randomly assigned to a control group (n = 25) and an experimental group (n = 25). This quasi -experimental research adopted a pretest-posttest control group design. The experimental group received eight weekly 90 -min sessions of positivity training. The control group participants did not receive any specific intervention related to depression management. The character strength scale, time perspective scale, self-awareness scale, and BDI-II were used to collect data. Data analysis methods included descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (ANCOVA). Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software. Results: The study included a sample of 50 women diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The participants' mean age was 38.03 years (SD = 7.96). Positivity training enhanced character strengths in women with depression. Moreover, the positivity intervention affected the time perspective factors of those women. It reduced "past negative" and "present fatalistic" and increased "past positive," "present hedonistic," and "future." Finally, positivity training significantly increased self-awareness in women with depression (p < 0.01). Limitations: The sample size was relatively small, which limits the statistical inferences. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study provides promising initial evidence for the potential of positivity training as an intervention to improve character strengths, time perspective, and self-awareness in women with MDD. Further research is warranted to confirm and expand upon these findings, ultimately informing the development of more comprehensive treatment approaches for depression.},

  abstract={Recognizing strengths in romantic partners is associated with relationship quality. However, is mere recognition sufficient, or does genuine appreciation play a more pivotal role? We address this question in a mixed-methods study comprising 90 heterosexual couples, randomly allocated into one of three groups: (1) intervention: six weekly 20-minute sessions of mutual appreciation of partners' strengths used during the week; (2) placebo control: six weekly sessions focused on mutual sharing of paired interactions, and (3) no-treatment control. Participants completed questionnaires measuring marital satisfaction and burnout before, immediately following, and a month following the 6-week intervention. Additionally, before and after the intervention, participants rated two perceptions of partner strengths: (1) the benefits (the utility and effectiveness associated with their use) and (2) the costs (potential drawbacks of their use). The main analyses showed no significant effect of the intervention. However, a non-significant trend was observed among women, but not men, in the intervention group between the initial and post-intervention evaluations of benefits. Qualitative analysis revealed that compared with men, women were significantly more attributed with strengths of social intelligence and love and were nearly twice as likely as men to express appreciation for their partners' strengths-based behaviors directed toward them. Whether due to women being more attuned to these actions or men being more inclined to demonstrate strengths to their wives, women reported accruing greater benefits from their partners' strengths than men. Overall, this study emphasizes the contribution of behavioral-based appreciation for the partner's strengths in enhancing relationship quality, particularly for women.},

  abstract={Existing studies have revealed associations of positive psychological traits with human thriving and flourishing. However, how these traits co-occur-known as covitality-and how it relates to flourishing remain relatively unexplored. This study aimed to investigate how student covitality as a second-order construct of four school experience-grounded positive psychological traits, namely gratitude, optimism, zest and persistence, predicts flourishing among primary school students. Participants were fourth to sixth graders (N = 1,107, 36.2% Grade 4, 32.8% Grade 5, and 31.0% Grade 6; 50.4% female) from 34 primary schools in Hong Kong (7.1% Hong Kong Island, 36.4% Kowloon, and 56.5% New Territories). In this study, structural equation modelling showed that student covitality as a second-order construct predicted flourishing directly (beta = .594), and also indirectly through resilience (beta = .111) and prosocial behaviour (beta = .062). The findings suggest that student covitality as a latent construct better captures the mechanisms that drive student flourishing than the four individual first-order constructs of positive psychological traits. This study sheds light on future efforts in the field of children's flourishing to consider school-related covitality as a critical variable in research and to develop school-based strategies that promote covitality in practice.},

  abstract={Peer mentorship shows promise as a strategy to support veteran mental health. A community-academic partnership involving a veteran-led nonprofit organization and institutions of higher education evaluated a collaboratively developed peer mentor intervention. We assessed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), postdeployment experiences, social functioning, and psychological strengths at baseline, midpoint, and 12-week discharge using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory-2, Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale, and Values in Action Survey. Brief weekly check-in surveys reinforced mentor contact and assessed retention. The sample included 307 veterans who were served by 17 veteran peer mentors. Mixed-effects linear models found a modest effect for PTSD symptom change, with a mean PCL-5 score reduction of 4.04 points, 95% CI [-6.44, -1.64], d = 0.44. More symptomatic veterans showed a larger effect, with average reductions of 9.03 points, 95% CI [-12.11, -5.95], d = 0.77. There were no significant findings for other outcome variables. Compared to younger veterans, those aged 32-57 years were less likely to drop out by 6 weeks, aORs = 0.32-0.26. Week-by-week hazard of drop-out was lower with mentors >= 35 years old, aHR = 0.62, 95% CI [0.37, 1.05]. Unadjusted survival differed by mentor military branch, p = .028, but the small mentor sample reduced interpretability. Like many community research efforts, this study lacked a control group, limiting the inferences that can be drawn. Continued study of veteran peer mentorship is important as this modality is often viewed as more tolerable than therapy.},

Although we did not find the predicted positive total effects of the intervention on optimism, life satisfaction, well-being, curiosity or love of learning from pre to post, we did find positive indirect effects on all of these variables via changes in Enticing world belief. We discuss inferential limitations regarding the observed effects as well as possible reasons for the lack of positive total effects on well-being measures and character strengths.

  abstract={Understanding the individual qualities sustaining students with and without specific learning disabilities (SLDs) is key to supporting their academic achievement and well-being. In this study, we investigated the differences between students with and without SLDs in terms of intraindividual factors (soft skills and study-related factors), academic and nonacademic outcomes (achievement, academic and life satisfaction), and the relationships between such intraindividual factors and the three outcomes. A total of 318 students (79 males; Mage = 22.7; SD = 3.56; age range = 19–45 years; 147 with SLDs) completed self-reported questionnaires and a measure of fluid intelligence. The results showed that students with SLDs reported higher creativity but lower academic self-efficacy, study resilience, and academic achievement, with small-to-medium effect sizes. In both groups, achievement significantly positively related to academic self-efficacy and negatively to creativity. Life satisfaction was positively related to study resilience; and academic satisfaction was related to critical thinking, curiosity, and academic self-efficacy. Nurturing such intraindividual factors can benefit students with and without SLDs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={Positive psychological interventions (PPIs) are activities that target positive variables (e.g., gratitude or kindness) to elicit a positive response in a population, such as improving adaptive functioning, promoting well-being, reducing depression, or enhancing quality of life. Despite several decades of evidence, a meta-analysis by White et al. (2019) concluded that the effect sizes of PPIs may be smaller than previously recorded and that their effects on depression may be generally nonsignificant. In the current study, we created a new PPI, called the Best-Self PPI (BS-PPI), to provide a proof-of-concept of two relatively unexplored properties of PPIs that may enhance effect sizes, which are: (1) combining PPI domains (i.e., multiple targeted positive variables) into a single intervention and (2) designing PPIs to target cognitive mechanisms of change. Using a double-masked procedure, we randomly assigned undergraduate students (n = 133) between the ages of 18 and 32 (Mage = 19.97, SD = 1.66; women; n = 85, 63.9%; White: n = 87, 65.41%) to complete either the BS-PPI – containing elements of meaning, character strengths, and optimism – or a control condition before completing measures of depression, psychological well-being, and affect. One day later, the participants completed a measure of affect and the Self-Referential Encoding Task, a behavioral measure of self-referential processing bias, which is the strength and the valance of the words one uses to describe oneself, to test the potential of targeting a cognitive mechanism of change. One week later, participants completed measures of depression, psychological well-being, and affect. The results suggest the BS-PPI did not affect depression, well-being, or affect compared to the control group despite the consistency of this study with many other PPI studies (e.g., sample size, design, and population), which aligns with the White et al. (2019) meta-analysis. We discuss the implications of this failed proof-of-concept for PPI research and recommendations for moving forward with these relatively unexplored properties.

  abstract={The aims explored associations between stress ratings and influences on coping and personality on student course satisfaction and anxiety. Most research construes stress as distress, with little attempt to consider positive ‘eustress’ experiences. Undergraduate students (N = 162) were surveyed on student and pandemic-related stressors, personality, support, control and on course satisfaction and anxiety. For course satisfaction, conscientiousness was the strongest predictor, followed by uplifting ratings of learning resources adapted during the pandemic. These uplifting ratings also support the efficacy of optimism. Support ratings were significant, but only as a hassle. This suggests work still needs to be done to maximise support opportunities on virtual learning platforms. Lack of motivation was strongly associated with anxiety. Context control and optimism had a buffering and mediating effect on levels of anxiety. Optimistic thinking strategies were effective in managing pandemic circumstances outside student control. Conscientiousness, control, support and optimism are integral in building student coping. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, there is a lack of investigation into how different modes of delivering psychological interventions influence well‐being outcomes in the teaching profession, such as preschool educators. This study examines the effects of different technologically driven modes of implementing a PROSPER‐based psychological intervention on positivity, relationship, outcome, strengths, purpose, engagement, and resilience. One hundred twenty‐eight pre‐service preschool teachers were randomly assigned to (1) the full intervention (i.e., online workshop and smartphone app); (2) the online workshop; (3) the smartphone app; and (4) the wait‐list control group. The results demonstrated that the online workshop mode yielded the strongest intervention effects on well‐being outcomes: positivity, purpose, engagement, and resilience. Although the smartphone app mode did not significantly improve psychological outcomes, combining this approach with the online workshop format appeared to have positive retention effects on positivity at the Time 3 follow‐up. The findings suggest that the traditional mode of implementing positive psychological interventions could be more effective than the smartphone app‐based mode in bolstering pre‐service teachers' well‐being.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between coping schemes with stress, virtues in action and resilience with psychological distress during the corona epidemic. 200 students (137 women and 63 men) between the ages of 20-40 were randomly selected and responded online to questionnaires of the Coping Schemas with Stress (CSI-R), Virtues in Action (VIA), Connor and Davidson's Resilience (CD-RISC) and Kessler's psychological distress (K-10). Findings showed that the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between coping schemes with stress and psychological distress is significant. Relationships between coping schemas with stress with virtues in action were also significant. The relationship between virtues in action with psychological distress was not significant. The results of the study indicate that in periods of stress and crisis, such as the Corona epidemic, programs based on promoting resilience is preferred in reducing the level of psychological distress than Programs to change coping schemas with stress and programs to promote positive virtues.

Fewer studies have examined potential moderators of these relationships. This study assessed the role of character strengths in the relationship between ACEs and negative physical and mental health outcomes in adulthood. An online sample of 1,491 adults completed questionnaires measuring character strengths, exposure to ACEs, and aspects of physical/mental health. Results replicated previous findings that ACEs and character strengths are each meaningfully related to health outcomes. Gratitude and self-regulation were generally indicative of better health outcomes, kindness and appreciation of beauty of poorer outcomes. Character strengths remained meaningful correlates of adult behavioral and emotional health even when controlling for ACEs. Character strengths did not moderate the relationship between ACEs and health, suggesting that character strengths do not mitigate the effects of ACEs, but do make an independent contribution to physical and mental health.

This study tested this hypothesis empirically in an online sample of self-identified agnostics (N = 360). Previous findings that anxious attachment to God is negatively related to agnostics’ well-being while secure attachment to God is positively related to agnostics’ well-being were confirmed and extended. Anxious attachment to God predicted unique variance in life satisfaction, depression, and self-esteem in hierarchical regressions, while difference-in-means tests indicated that securely attached agnostics fared better than their insecurely attached counterparts for these variables. Two novel and more direct measures of agnostics’ acceptance or resistance of God’s supposed love also demonstrated significant associations with agnostics’ gratitude, life satisfaction, and self-esteem, even after controlling for God attachment.

  abstract={Objective: To explore the relationship of character strengths, life stress events, and affective well-being in middle school students. Methods: A total of 576 middle school students in grade 7 to grade 12 were selected with the method of stratified sampling. The Chinese Virtues Questionnaire (CVQ) was used to measure the degree of their character strengths. Adolescent Self-rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC) to measure the degree of life stress events. Positive Affecting and Negative Affecting Scale (PANAS) to measure the degree of affective well-being. Bootstrap was used to test the mediating effect of life stress events on the relationship between character strengths and affective well-being. Results: The scores of CVQ were positively correlated with PANAS scores (r = 0.47,0. 55, 0. 31; Ps < 0.01), and negatively correlated with the scores of relationship (r = -0.43, -0.36, -0.28; Ps < 0.01)and academic stress (r = -0.29, -0.37, -0.33; Ps < 0.01). The scores of relationship and academic stress were negatively correlated with the scores of PANAS (r = -0.28, -0.66; Ps < 0.01). Regression analyses indicated that the scores of relationship and academic stress explained approximately 28% of the variance of affective well-being, while relationship, vitality, and conscientiousness contributed to another 9% of affective well-being. Bootstrap test showed that relationship stress scores mediated scores of relationship strength and affective well-being scores, and the mediating effect was 0. 36 ( 95% CI: 0.25-0.43), academic stress scores mediated scores of conscientiousness strength and affective well-being scores, and the mediating effect was 0. 39 ( 95% CI: 0.26-0.44). Conclusion: It suggests that relationship stress mediate the relationship between relationship strength and affective well-being, academic stress mediate the relationship between conscientiousness strength and affective well-being.

This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on older adultsʼ psychological distress (anxiety and depression) over time. Methods: A community‐dwelling Spaniard population (N = 192) completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics, appraisal and personal resources. Older adults took part in a longitudinal online survey collected in April 2020 (during the lockdown restrictions) and at two subsequent time points 3 and 9 months after baseline (without lockdown restrictions and during the third wave of the pandemic respectively). Results: Older adults did not evidence higher emotional distress than during the initial lockdown. Furthermore, depression remained stable and anxiety significantly decreased. Results also suggest that some sociodemographic characteristics, appraisals and personal resources are relevant. Older participants showed less anxiety than younger ones. Furthermore, being a male, resilience, and acceptance were related with the decrease of anxiety. Otherwise, fear of the COVID‐19 outbreak and depression were related with the increase of anxiety. Conclusion: Older adults may adapt to the adverse pandemic impact by using more adaptive resources that reduce their distress. Efforts to ameliorate older adults' anxiety by focusing on older adults' personal resources should be considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={The growing concerns regarding the risks of transmitting the COVID-19 virus have intensified the job-related stressors commonly encountered by teachers in various cultural contexts. Evidence shows how the COVID-19 crisis has negatively impacted teachers' mental health outcomes such as stress, depression, and quality of life, which highlights the significance of designing psychological programs to boost teachers' well-being. This study examined the effects of a well-being intervention based on the Positivity, Relationship, Outcomes, Strength, Purpose, Engagement, and Resilience (PROSPER) framework on well-being outcomes among 76 in-service teachers (Mage = 26.05 years, SD = 4.71, range = 20–45; female = 93.4%) in Hong Kong.

  abstract={This study aimed to understand the existing relationships between virtues, character strengths, subjective well-being and academic achievement in Angolan university students. Two hundred and eighteen students from the Catholic University of Angola participated in this research. Virtues and character strengths were assessed with the VIA survey 24; subjective well-being with the Mental Health Continuum—Short Form—for youth, and academic achievement with cumulative grade-point average and the number of previous school retentions. Regarding virtues and character strengths, transcendence, hope and love had the higher values, and temperance, self-regulation and creativity the lower ones. Our participants had higher levels of psychological well-being, and lower levels of social well-being. The correlations between virtues and character strengths, well-being and academic achievement showed that the overall well-being score is positive and significantly correlated with all virtues and the majority of character strengths. On the other hand, psychological well-being was more strongly related to virtues and character strengths. Finally, the correlations with academic achievement were scarce, in which only love of learning, temperance, appreciation of beauty and excellence and forgiveness seem to have correlations with the first variable. There is a further need to understand how these variables interact with academic achievement. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={Little is known about the intraindividual dispositional factors related to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional academic learning outcomes under COVID-19. This study investigated (i) the associations of intraindividual factors, some related to studying (motivation to learn, self-regulated learning, and study resilience), others more general (soft skills, intolerance of uncertainty) with three situational academic learning outcomes (general distress, online self-regulated learning, study-related emotions), and (ii) the effect of time, intraindividual factors, online self-regulated learning, and study-related emotions on distress and achievement over the following three exam sessions. A total of 331 university students took part in the study during the first Italian nationwide lockdown (T1; March–May 2020). Of those, 121 also completed at least one follow-up (T2: August 2020; T3: September 2020; T4: February 2021). At T1, study-related dispositions and soft skills were positively associated with online self-regulated learning and study-related emotions, while study-related dispositions were also negatively associated with general distress. Intolerance of uncertainty was associated positively with general distress and negatively with study-related emotions. Longitudinal effects of T2 and T3 for intolerance of uncertainty and study-related emotions were observed for distress, while those for T4 were study-related dispositions for achievement. Nurturing intraindividual factors can help students cope with a prolonged stressful situation such as a pandemic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

This study was designed to investigate the psychometric properties regarding the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the VIA-Youth. A tool developed to evaluate the character strengths of youth. In addition, character strengths were examined in terms of life satisfaction, values and demographic characteristics. 1963 high school students between 14-19 years participated in this study by completing VIA-Youth and the Human Values and Life Satisfaction inventories. The results confirm the six-factor model in the theoretical framework. It has also been concluded that character strengths affect life satisfaction and values and that socio demographic features are related to strengths. The adaptation of this inventory into Turkish culture contributes to the current understanding of the universal aspects of character strengths for studies within the context of positive youth development. Besides the adaptation, the relationships between character strengths, values, demographic characteristics and life satisfaction were discussed and suggestions were made.

Online questionnaires were used to assess positive personality, alexithymia, social connectedness and life satisfaction. Participants were also asked to view a series of standardized film clips and rate them on a list of nonprimary emotions to compute their emotional granularity. The results indicated that positive personality and alexithymia could predict an individual's life satisfaction directly or indirectly through social connectedness. Positive emotional granularity could predict alexithymia. However, positive emotional granularity could not predict life satisfaction directly, but it could predict life satisfaction through the path of alexithymia-social connectedness. These results provide implications for enhancing the well-being of Chinese college students by cultivating their positive psychological qualities and strengthening their social bonding.

  abstract={Is putting the interests of others ahead of one's own interests a virtuous tendency? Previous research has produced ambivalent results about this. Some existing constructs that involve prioritizing others' interests over one's own, such as unmitigated communion, are treated primarily as negative features of personality, while others, such as high other-focus, are treated primarily as positive features. This study involved developing a new scale to measure others-centeredness, a tendency derived from philosophical research which involves prioritizing others' interests over one's own because one judges each person's interests to be equally valuable while also valuing interpersonal unions. This scale is used in both correlational and experimental studies to demonstrate that others-centeredness is uniquely positively related to indicators of well-being when controlling for unmitigated communion and high other-focus, while the latter relate negatively to indicators of well-being, or lack positive associations with such, when controlling for others-centeredness. Accordingly, others-centeredness may be a uniquely positive, virtuous tendency to put others' interests first. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={The COVID-19 outbreak could be considered as an uncontrollable stressful life event. Lockdown measures have provoked a disruption of daily life with a great impact over older adults’ health and well-being. Nevertheless, eudaimonic well‐being plays a protective role in confronting adverse circumstances, such as the COVID-19 situation. This study aims to assess the association between age and psychological well-being (personal growth and purpose in life). Young–old (60–70 years) and old–old (71–80 years) community-dwelling Spaniards (N = 878) completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics and their levels of health, COVID-19 stress-related, appraisal, and personal resources. Old–old did not evidence poorer psychological well-being than young–old. Age has only a negative impact on personal growth. The results also suggest that the nature of the COVID-19 impact (except for the loss of a loved one) may not be as relevant for the older adults’ well-being as their appraisals and personal resources for managing COVID-related problems. In addition, these results suggest that some sociodemographic and health-related variables have an impact on older adults’ well-being. Thus, perceived-health, family functioning, resilience, gratitude, and acceptance had significant associations with both personal growth and purpose in life. Efforts to address older adults’ psychological well-being focusing on older adults’ personal resources should be considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Maintaining the ability and life satisfaction of the elderly, despite the inevitable changes in their condition, can be effective in promoting communities. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to consider the effectiveness of positivism training on life satisfaction and character strengths in the elderly men. It was a quasi-experimental study with pretest, posttest and control group design. The statistical population of the study included all elderly men who were retirees of Oil Company in Khoram Abad in 2020. The samples of this study consisted of 30 men elderlies (60-70 age) selected using convenience sampling and according to inclusion criteria. The experimental group received eight ninety-minute sessions during two months while the control group didn’t receive any intervention during conducting the study. The applied questionnaires in the study included Character Strengths Scale and Life Satisfaction Scale. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis of covariance in SPSS-22 software. The results showed that there was significant difference between experimental and control groups in terms of life satisfaction and character strengths (P < 0.001). In other words, positivism training resulted in life satisfaction and character strengths in the elderly men. According to the findings of the current study, positivism training can be suggested as an effective method in order to increase life satisfaction and character strengths in the elderly men.

This classification is claimed to be universal across cultures and religions (Peterson & Seligman, 2004) and its measure that is, Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) has been translated and validated in many languages. The present study aimed at its Urdu translation and validation on Pakistani adults taken from different educational institutes and workplaces. Study comprised two parts. Part I dealt with the translation and cross-language validation while in Part II, construct validation on a sample of 542 adults and convergent validity on a sample of 210 adult participants were determined. Findings revealed satisfactory alpha coefficients for Urdu version. Significant positive correlations with positive affect and life satisfaction and negative correlations with negative affect were indicators of its convergent validity. Age was negatively associated with five strengths whereas significant gender differences were found on seven strengths. Social desirability effects were nonsignificant. Strength-to-virtue level factor structure exploration resulted in a theoretically meaningful four factor structure. Factors were named as Interpersonal, Cognitive, Vitality, and Transcendence and were comparable to factor structures proposed in studies on VIA-IS from a few other cultures. The study offers a valid Urdu translation for use in future studies with adult Urdu speaking population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Peterson and Seligman (2004) developed and validated the 240-item Virtues in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) to assess character strengths and virtues that enable optimal human thriving. However, VIA-IS is often considered too long for use by clinicians in their private practices, as well as for researchers interested in conducting positive psychology research. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a 24-item Values in Action Semantic Differential Scale (VIA-SDS) in a sample of 231 Singaporean university students. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a 4-factor measurement structure (Humanity, Optimism, Leadership, and Creativity) with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranging from .67 to .88. Three of the four latent variables were positively associated with happiness and negatively related to perceived stress and depression. These findings support the validity of the VIA-SDS for use as a brief clinical assessment instrument by clinicians and researchers to assess character strengths.

The current research investigated the factor structure, measurement invariance, internal consistency reliability, convergent and incremental validity, and test-retest reliability of the Chinese version of the Encouragement Character Strength Scale (ECSS). The bifactor exploratory structural equation modeling (bifactor-ESEM) resulted in the best-fit indices and unbiased parameter estimates with the joint presence of the general encouragement character strength factor and the two specific factors (i.e., perceived ability and enjoyment). The total and factor scores of the ECSS showed good internal consistency reliability in all samples. Measurement invariance across gender was confirmed. In support of their convergent validity, the ECSS scores showed strong associations with measures of kindness, hope, social connectedness, extroversion, agreeableness, and psychological well-being. After controlling the variables of kindness, hope, social connectedness, extroversion, and agreeableness, the ECSS showed incremental validity for psychological well-being. Test-retest reliability was established for the total and factor scores of the ECSS. Overall, the Chinese version of the ECSS seems to be an effective and dependable scale for measuring the encouragement character strength construct.

Results: People with schizophrenia achieved significantly lower scores than those in the control group in terms of such strengths of character like: hope, humor, self-regulation, citizenship, leadership, capacity for love, kindness, social/emotional intelligence, bravery, industry, integrity, zest, curiosity, love of learning, perspective/wisdom. People with schizophrenia are also different from healthy people in terms of experiencing life satisfaction. At the same time, they do not differ in such strengths of character as: originality, judgment, fairness, forgiveness/mercy, modesty/humility, prudence, appreciation for beauty, gratitude, spirituality. The character strengths of people in the clinical group (more often than in the control group) are associated with the sense of life satisfaction. In older people suffering from schizophrenia, many strengths of their character are reduced. Conclusions: People with schizophrenia are different from those in the control group in terms of 15 strengths. They are also less satisfied with their lives. Experiencing life satisfaction of people with schizophrenia is associated with a complex configuration of strengths. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Principal references from Positive Psychology propose six virtues and 24 strengths, whereas subjective well-being is appraised by life satisfaction, positive and negative affects. This study aimed to analyze the association between the level of character strengths and subjective well-being. The authors used two scales, namely the Subjective Well-being Scale (EBES) and the Strengths Scale, with 237 university students. All strengths correlated significantly with at least one aspect of subjective well-being. Negative affect was significantly correlated to only two strengths: creativity and vitality. Life satisfaction items showed 16 significant correlations, and the general factor of subjective well-being also showed 16 significant correlations. The results have partially confirmed the theoretical assumptions. The authors discuss the influence of cultural aspects and the need to empirically test the assumptions)},

  abstract={ABSTRACT The main objective of this study was to explore the associations between character strengths and internalising and externalising problems. One thousand, one hundred thirty-eight adolescents, completed the 96-item VIA Inventory of Strengths for Youth, Youth Self Report, and Brief Symptom Inventory. Using latent class analysis, we extracted six latent groups: (1) Externalising and Internalising Problems (EIP; 11.1%), (2) Internalising Problems (IP; 15.6%), (3) Externalising Problems (EP; 12.5%), (4) At-risk for Externalising Problems (R-EP; 16.1%), (5) At-risk for Internalising Problems (R-IP; 27.3%) and (6) Healthy Subjects (H-S; 17.5%). General linear models on the BSI scores showed that those in EIP reported the most severe symptoms on all the BSI scales and those in H-S had the lowest scores. We concluded that character strengths take part in the etiology of externalising and internalising disorders. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={Understanding Chinese international students' psychological adjustment and acculturation is important in providing effective counseling services for this population. Historically, international students have been viewed from a pathological model by focusing on the problems they experience in the adjustment process. This study was an examination of how predictive Chinese international students' virtues (values that are composed of character strengths) were of the two measures that are related to adjusting to their lives in the United States. These two measures are psychological distress and psychological well-being. A principal components analysis (PCA) with a Varimax rotation was conducted with the 24 character traits identified by Peterson and Seligman (2004) and measured by the VIA-IS-72 (VIA-IS; Peterson & Seligman, 2004, 2009; VIA Institute, 2014). Four principal components representing virtues, agency/proactivity, conscientiousness, interpersonal strengths/sociability, and vitality, were retained. The results of two stepwise regression analyses indicated that Chinese international students with more vitality experienced greater psychological well-being and less psychological distress; however, counter to expectations, students with greater agency experienced less psychological well-being and more psychological distress. Results and recommendations will be discussed in light of multicultural theory, specifically regarding the cultural conflicts among Chinese international students studying in the United States.

  abstract={The study of positive traits or strengths has been the cornerstone of positive psychology. Positive psychology assumes that positive variables are different in nature from psychopathological variables and they do not necessarily improve with a usual psychotherapeutic treatment. They would require another type of intervention to progress: a positive intervention. Studies on character strengths in the clinical population are very scarce and, in general, focused on depression. Previous studies found that higher levels of hope, vitality, spirituality and leadership strengths were related to lower levels of anxiety and depression. In addition, lower levels of gratitude have been linked to symptoms of depression. The study of strengths and progress during treatment is very limited, whereas the relationship between strengths of character and treatment process has not yet been investigated. This research aims to: 1) study the 24 character strengths in adult patients who are at different stages of a naturalistic cognitive behavioral treatment; and 2) to analyze the relationship of character strengths with progress during treatment, therapeutic alliance and adherence to treatment from the therapist's perspective.

Participants in the ‘counting kindness’ intervention were asked to keep track of their kind actions every day for a week and write them on the forum along with their feelings and thoughts on those actions. Participants in the control group were asked to write their daily routine also every day for a week. Participants were also asked to complete questionnaires measuring subjective wellbeing before the intervention, a month after, and two months after the intervention (follow-up measurement). The results showed that subjective wellbeing as an overall sense of wellbeing and its specific components was enhanced for participants in the kindness intervention. Possible mechanisms for the effectiveness of the intervention are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

Students with greater SWB tend to have stronger relationships with their teachers and classmates, as well as behave in more positive ways. Drawing from theory and research pertinent to promoting children’s SWB, we developed an 11-session classwide positive psychology intervention that targeted elementary school students’ novel use of character strengths, gratitude, kindness, and relationships in the classroom. Throughout a pilot study, children in fourth grade experienced clinically meaningful lasting gains in multiple indicators of SWB, particularly positive affect and satisfaction with self, but no changes in distal indicators of behavioral student engagement (attendance, office disciplinary referrals). This initial application by school psychologists partnering with a classroom teacher provides evidence of promise that elementary school children can benefit from participation in universal positive psychology interventions that target internal assets (gratitude, kindness, and signature strengths) and environmental resources (student-teacher and peer relationships).

Character strengths can serve as a buffer against psychopathology. The aim of the study was to examine perceived stress and negative attributional style as mediating factors between character strengths and depression among Turkish college students. Bootstrap testing approach was implemented to compute direct and indirect effects and total effect in the mediation analysis. Altogether 235 students from two Turkish universities participated in the study. The results showed that character strengths were associated with lower levels of depression and it was negatively associated with perceived stress and negative attributional style. The results also indicated that perceived stress and negative attribution style completely mediated the relationship between character strengths and depression among Turkish college students. These findings suggested the need to develop empirically supported interventions that can promote character strengths toward reducing stress, negative attributions, and depression in this population.

The similarities and differences between the Greek and other cultures’ models are being discussed. The VIA-114GR demonstrated adequate reliability, convergent validity to wellbeing indices, and discriminant validity to negative experiences. Gender and age differences were found in several strengths and virtues. Also, the findings showed that the five signature strengths of the Greek sample were kindness, love, honesty, fairness, and persistence and the five bottom strengths were love of learning, spirituality, perspective, modesty, and self-regulation. Limitations, recommendations for future studies, and practical implications for the use of VIA-114GR are being discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={There has been an increase in students seeking counseling services in universities, with depression and anxiety being the most prevalent presenting concerns. Previous research indicates that the use of character strengths has been effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Many of the interventions used to develop character strengths and improve well-being involve a social component, yet no research has investigated how social activity relates to the link between character strengths and well-being. In this study, relationships between the following variables were explored: character strengths (love, hope, curiosity, zest), subjective well-being, social activity, and social group participation. Social activity as a mediator of character strengths and well-being was also explored. Data were collected from 254 college-age students, ranging from 18 to 24 years of age (M = 20.60). One outlier was removed from the data, ending with 253 total participants, with 67% female (n=169) and 33% male (n=84). Descriptive statistics, frequency statistics, Pearson product-moment correlations, independent samples t-tests, and hierarchical multiple regression were used. Males endorsed higher levels of social activity (M = 24.67, SD = 4.93) than female participants (M = 23.07, SD = 4.01). Additionally, there were statistically significant differences in subjective well-being and endorsement of love scores, with females scoring higher than male participants. Consistent with previous research, results show a moderate positive correlation between subjective well-being and love (r(250) = .467, p < .01), hope (r(250) = .357, p < .01), curiosity (r(250) = .387, p < .01), zest (r(250) = .429, p < .01). Inconsistent with previous research, a significant relationship between social activity and well-being was not found. A positive significant relationship between social group participation and well-being was found r(250) = .197, p < .01 as well as between social group participation and love r(250) = .127, p < .05, curiosity r(250) = .159, p < .05, and zest r(250) = .184, p < .05. No significant relationship was found for hope. Results of the Sobel test suggest that mediation was not present.

  abstract={The idea underlying this work is that character strengths are an essential component for achieving life fulfillment. In order to determine the extent to which strengths of character are essential to living a good life, this study was conducted from laypeople’s point of view. This work took as theoretical framework Seligman’s recent theory, known under the acronym of PERMA, which proposes that human strengths are vehicles for achieving positive emotions, engagement (flow), enriching relationships, meaning in life, and accomplishment of personal goals. This study considered life fulfillment beyond the hedonic conception of subjective well-being emphasizing the importance of both individual and social meaning; the relationship with others; and the achievement of personal goals, among others. A sample of 687 adults evaluated the importance of 24 character strengths from the Values in Action classification for the five areas that contribute to a fulfilling life: personal well-being, personal goals, personal relationships, work relationships, and contributing to a better country. This study used a similar methodology to Biswas-Diener (2006), who studied the attitudes towards the 24 VIA character strengths with members of dissimilar cultural groups. An instrument was designed comprising 24 items in a survey-format. Each item assessed one character strength for each of the five areas under study. Cronbach’s alpha reliability test for the overall scale was .98. Data was analyzed by calculating frequencies (e.g., the degree of endorsement to the character strengths in relation to life fulfillment) and conducting chi-square tests (e.g., gender and age differences). The character strengths over the 90th percentile were considered. The results showed that the character strength honesty is an important personal resource for the five areas studied. Specifically, love, honesty and zest were the major character strengths for personal well-being; persistence and self-regulation for achieving life goals; honesty and gratitude for developing positive personal relationships; citizenship and fairness for positive work relationships; and, fairness and honesty for contributing to a better country. Differences by gender were found. For the majority of the areas of life explored, women placed more importance on character strengths than men. The main finding of this study is that people consider the strengths of character from the VIA classification as important elements for life fulfillment. Most participants in this study showed a high degree of endorsement (60 to 70%) to each of the character strengths of the VIA classification for all the areas, i.e., achieving personal well-being, accomplishing life goals, enriching personal relationships, working well with others, and contributing to a better country. Based on these results, it can be concluded that from the point of view of lay-people, character strengths are not only fundamental to feel good but also to function well both in relation to themselves and to the world. Overall, intervention strategies, from the Positive Psychology perspective, tend to be generic and unspecific, without considering individuals’ particular points of view. Knowing people’s implicit ideas in relation to the strengths that contribute most to life fulfillment would allow generating more accurate and culturally adjusted interventions to the particular group in question. This adjustment not only operates as a key motivational aspect but also a reinforcement of the effect of the intervention. Future studies should experimentally compare the effectiveness of generic interventions on character strengths versus interventions focused on those strengths that the group under study deems important, especially in Latino populations in which the efficacy of these interventions has not been tested yet, and little has been studied in relation to this topic.

The current study evaluated the psychometric equivalency of a visual and a verbal version of a single‐item connectedness measure; the aim was to determine whether the different formats can be used interchangeably depending on feasibility. Methods: Participants were 133 jail inmates (49% male; 43% Black; Mage = 35 years, SD = 10 years) interviewed just before release from jail. Results: Results provide evidence for the concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity of the two ICS versions. Attempts to calibrate the verbal measure to the visual measure were moderately successful. Conclusion: Taken together, results suggest the two formats are comparable, but not interchangeable; they map on to other variables in similar ways but cannot be used in lieu of one another.

Seligman hypothesized that any strength of character, when exercised on a regular basis, contributes to the psychological good life and by implication to the life of meaning. Park, Peterson, and Seligman showed that certain strengths of character—namely, curiosity, gratitude, hope, love, and zest—are robustly associated with life satisfaction among adults, more so than such other strengths of character as judgment, creativity, and love of learning; and Peterson interpreted these findings as showing that the heart matters more than the head when one's concern is with the psychological good life. Given the Western world's emphasis, at least since the time of Aristotle, on intellectual and mental abilities, these are intriguing results. Assuming that we want our children to be happy, they imply that parents and schools should encourage the emotional strengths that tie people together as much as the cognitive skills that allow individual accomplishment. What good is critical thinking if not accompanied by uncritical caring? In the present contribution, we describe new data that bear directly on the issue of how character strengths might be associated with a life of meaning. This research employed the Orientation to Happiness Scale developed by Peterson, Park, and Seligman and Steger, Frazier, Oishi, and Kaler's measure that divides the construct of meaning into two components: the presence of meaning and the search for meaning. To introduce our study, we first provide some background on how positive psychologists have approached good character. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={Curiosity is innate character strength of an individual motivating oneself to investigate and learn about the subject matter of interest leading towards the personal and professional satisfaction in life. Meaning in life charts the way of regulating and directing attention to continuously evaluate one’s personal values and life goals. Emotional intelligence influences an individual’s physical and mental health as well as career aspirations and achievements in changing environmental situations. All these three factors may possibly influence an individual’s present and past experiences to forecast one’s potential areas for growth and development in the form of personal growth initiative. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to assess the influence of curiosity and meaning of life on one’s personal growth, moderated with emotional intelligence. The empirical study has been carried out with the professional students of a premier technical institution in India. Results have revealed that personal growth initiative is positively associated with curiosity and meaningful life. Findings have indicated that both the constructs are significantly moderated by emotional intelligence for predicting personal growth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

Methods: A sample of children with a life threatening illness (N = 67, ages 7-18 years) completed the Benefit Finding Scale for Children (BFSC) and other positive and negative measures of psychological functioning. Results: Children exposed to a moderate severity of their disease had the strongest levels of BF. While BF was positively associated with different dimensions of well-being, it was generally not related to distress with some exceptions in the health-related quality of life domain. Conclusion: Our results showed that BF reflects a positive outcome in its own right and not just a mere reduction of distress. Yet, there are some health-related domains of quality of life that should be considered in therapeutic intervention to facilitate BF. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

The current study used a past, present, and future framework of positive emotions to explore parent and child levels of gratitude, life satisfaction, and hope. Correlations between self-reported levels of gratitude, life satisfaction, and hope were analyzed in a sample of 148 fourth and fifth grade students and their biological parents (137 mothers, 109 fathers). Findings include statistically significant relationships between (1) mother and child gratitude (but not father and child gratitude) and (2) child life satisfaction and both mothers’ and fathers’ life satisfaction. No significant relationships emerged between parent hope and child hope, although higher parent life satisfaction was associated with higher child hope. Research is needed to investigate the causes of the links identified in the current study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

This gap in psychological literature may serve to limit a thorough understanding of wisdom. Positive psychology may allow for some rapprochement in wisdom and spirituality. In collaboration with leaders of a local Friends (Quaker) congregation, two studies investigated the effects of a spiritually informed wisdom intervention delivered in the context of a faith community. Participants for Study 1 consisted of 27 young adults (24 completed both the pre and post questionnaire) and a comparison group consisting of 32 young adults. The intervention was designed to increase participants’ abilities in cognitive, affective and moral domains. Significant group by time interaction effects were found among measurements of practical wisdom, post-formal thinking and subjective well-being, with those in the experimental group showing changes in the expected direction. Study 2 involved qualitative analyses of interviews with 15 of the wisdom participants regarding their changing views of wisdom. Themes emerging from the interviews included a multiple-perspectives view of wisdom, the relational nature of learning wisdom, the importance of taking a reflective perspective, and congruence between what one knows and how one lives. Implications for studying wisdom alongside religion and spirituality are considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Although results from past research have consistently suggested that the use of strengths is associated with higher performance and greater well-being there is, as yet, no clear theory describing how using strengths might contribute to greater well-being or goal progress. The objective of the current research was to test a model of how strengths use may support performance and well-being through an extension of the self-concordance model of healthy goal attainment. Design: We test a repeated measures cross-sectional model in which using signature strengths is associated with goal progress, which is in turn associated with the fulfillment of psychological needs, and in turn wellbeing. Method: Participants were 240 college students who completed measures of psychological strengths, need satisfaction, well-being, goal progress and goal attainment at three time points over a three-month period. Results: Our results demonstrate that strengths use is associated with better goal progress, which is in turn associated with psychological need fulfillment and enhanced well-being. Conclusions: Strengths use provides a key support in the attainment of goals, and leads to greater need satisfaction and well-being, providing an extension of the self-concordance model of healthy goal attainment.

  abstract={With the development of positive psychology, protective factors have received increased attention as buffers against suicidal ideation and attempts and against the risk factors for suicide (e.g., depressive symptoms). Empirical evidence suggests that one of the protective factors associated with depression and suicide is forgiveness. Although previous studies have demonstrated a negative association between forgiveness and risk of suicide, studies on gender differences in adolescents are still scarce. Thus, the authors assessed the moderating role of gender in a sample of adolescents. The participants were 572 adolescents (50.9% boys; M age = 15.49 years, SD = 1.09 years) from secondary school centers. The results revealed that forgiveness moderated the relationship between depression and suicidal ideation for boys but not for girls. Specifically, for boys the relationship between depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviors weakened as levels of forgiveness increased. These findings suggest therapeutic applications to reduce the likelihood of suicide in the group of adolescent boys with higher scores on depression and lower levels of forgiveness. The study results are discussed in terms of the need to use gender perspectives in positive psychology intervention programs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of the psychological resources which may be involved in the identification and use of positive attributes, especially of character strengths and signature strengths, which are considered as adaptive and related to well-being. Thirty-three participants from different mental health treatment centers were included in the study. In addition, each patient was asked to assess their own signature strengths and then to estimate the signature strengths of their respective friend or family member using a questionnaire. Each friend or family member also performed the same task. Psychological mindedness is involved in the detection of one’s own strengths and this detection of signature strengths is related to an individual’s knowledge of them and to their use. These are particularly important in positive psychotherapy, which aims to help people use their character and signature strengths. PM also plays a role in recognizing the signature strengths of others. Finally, the results suggest a negative impact of depression on PM and on the identification of one’s signature strengths. It is thus important to focus on these aspects from the beginning of therapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results: The overall internal consistency coefficient of CVQ-96 is 0.945, and the three subscales ranged from 0.878 to 0.923; retest reliability of three subscales ranged from was 0.738 to 0.826; the Fit Index of confirmatory factor analysis on the three-factor structure of CVQ-96 were acceptable; three dimensions of the CVQ-96 were positively correlated with positive psychological variables(hope and gratitude), while negatively correlated with the negative ones (anxiety and depression), which reflected the good criterion validity of this scale. Conclusion: The Chinese Virtues Questionnaire (CVQ-96) had good psychometric characteristics, and can be applied in Chinese adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={The advent of positive psychology has triggered research into positive interventions, which focus on strengths instead of deficits. The present study aims to investigate the effects of gratitude and strengths-based interventions on happiness and depressive symptoms against a control group, as well as to explore personality traits as moderator variables of the potential effectiveness of these interventions. A total of 122 participants completed at least two stages of the research. Data were collected at three stages—baseline pre-test, post-intervention assessment, and 1-month follow-up assessment. The findings partially support the effectiveness of the gratitude and strengths-based interventions in increasing happiness and decreasing depressive symptoms compared to a control group. Two personality domains showed significance as moderator variables. More research is needed to enable a higher degree of control when administering these promising interventions.

Young adults from the United States (n = 1099) and Japan (n = 308) completed the English or Japanese versions of the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths. American and Japanese showed similar distributions of the 24 strengths measured: Higher strengths included love, humor and kindness, and lesser strengths included prudence, self-regulation, and modesty. Gender differences across cultures were also similar: Females were more likely than males to report strengths of love and kindness, whereas males were more likely to report bravery and creativity. In both samples, associations with happiness were found for zest, hope, curiosity and gratitude. The present study is a first step in an international study of character strengths, and we discuss the ubiquity and variation of character across culture.

Relying on a large Internet sample (N = 7348) of adults from the United States, we found that across occupations, character strengths of curiosity, zest, hope, gratitude, and spirituality were associated with work satisfaction. We also found interpretable differences across occupations for several strengths of character, although these were small in magnitude. Good character is not the province of workers in any given occupation, despite obvious differences across jobs in educational requirements, status, and salary. Our data provided some support for the notion of complementary fit between strengths of character and work satisfaction. If a worker in a given occupation scored higher on a less typical strength of character within that occupation, then he or she was more likely to be satisfied with work. The chapter concludes with directions for research and implications for practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract={This research investigates the contents, antecedents, and mediators of happiness in the Indian state of Assam. The first study examines the content and meanings of happiness in Assamese culture. Posing exploratory questions, a thematic analysis of the narrations of 53 participants revealed 18 themes, grouped into intrinsic or content and extrinsic or context factors of happiness. The content and meanings of happiness embrace a blend of ancient Indian, Eastern, and Western concepts. Based on these results, a culture-sensitive happiness scale is constructed in the second study. It further tests whether life skills mediate the relationship between character strength and happiness. Data from 503 Assamese participants showed that the one-factor model of happiness, combining all 14 items of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, is acceptable. It has measurement invariance across male and female genders and high- and low-income groups. To ensure criterion-related validity, the happiness of people is associated with their well-being profiles. Adjusting the confounding effects of age and sex of participants, it is observed that character strengths do not promote happiness but pass through life skills fully to promote happiness. © 2023 Asian Association of Social Psychology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

  abstract={The study of character strengths stems from positive psychology’s quest to understand positive personality traits that foster positive functioning and flourishing. Signature strengths are character strengths that are considered particularly relevant to the identity of the individual. These have been related to subjective well-being (SWB) in both cross-sectional and intervention studies. However, contributors to this relationship remain unclear. The present study examined the following possible explanations for the relationship between signature strengths and SWB: the perceived ability to use signature strengths, recognition of signature strengths by others, and valuing of signature strengths by one’s school, workplace, and country. Also, existing approaches to identifying signature strengths do not accurately reflect the construct as it was originally conceived. To address these issues, this study used the Signature Strengths Survey (McGrath in Technical report: the VIA assessment suite for adults: development and initial evaluation, rev ed. VIA Institute on Character, Cincinnati, 2019), which was developed to address inadequacies in current measurement methods, allowing the respondent to set the number of signature strengths. In a sample of 2875 adults recruited online, results revealed that signature strengths being perceived as valued and recognized by others, rather than identification with and enactment of particular strengths, best predicted SWB. Results merit replication, but suggest that focus on signature strengths valued by others in one’s environment can be particularly contributory to SWB. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

  abstract={Appreciative joy refers to feeling happy for others with appreciative and unenvious attitudes, which is a strength-like construct emphasized much more in Chinese than in Western culture. The current study provides an initial exploration of appreciative joy’s relationship with the strengths in the Values in Action (VIA) framework. Study 1 with 516 online participants showed that appreciative joy was positively correlated with the VIA strengths and provided an incremental explanation for subjective well-being and envy after controlling for the 24 VIA strengths. Study 2 recruited 559 readers of a Chinese novel (The Dream of the Red Chamber) and showed that appreciative joy was associated with the perception of the outstanding strength of characters in the novel after controlling for interpersonal strengths. These findings illustrate both similarities and differences between appreciative joy and strengths in VIA and hold multiple implications for research on appreciative joy, positive psychology and cultural diversity. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Results demonstrated that love and leadership served as the most robust predictors of basic psychological needs satisfaction. Love was consistently associated with higher well-being outcomes. Whereas leadership was linked to higher levels of satisfaction with all dimensions of basic needs, this strength was related to lower levels of emotional well-being. Further, love, social intelligence, leadership, and kindness had indirect effects on life satisfaction, positive emotions, and flourishing via the satisfaction of basic needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence.

However, the co- or non-existence of a general factor (G-factor) of good character and the specific factors (S-factors) of character strengths (i.e., inquisitiveness, caring, and self-control) remain debatable. A total of 1866 individuals from Mainland China completed the Three-dimensional Inventory of Character Strengths (TICS), of which a sub-sample (N = 498) also completed the additional Flourishing Scale. The bifactor Exploratory Structural Equation Model (bifactor-ESEM) were tested, results showed the bifactor-ESEM model of character strengths had excellent goodness-of-fit. G-factor and the S-factors were well defined by the presence of strong and significant target loadings. The G-factor and S-factors’ contribution to wellbeing were further examined through ESEM-within-CFA (EwC) method. The G-factor significantly explained the 50.3% variance of wellbeing when it was the sole predictor and remained significant when inquisitiveness, caring, and self-control factors were considered. The present study confirmed the G-factor of character strengths and its significant contribution to wellbeing. Future studies can develop clinical and non-clinical wellbeing enhancement interventions with a focus on general and specific character strengths that transcend the current signature-strengths paradigm. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Theoretical background: One of the most significant achievements of positive psychology, which defines itself as the science of happiness and human strengths, is the creation of a taxonomy of character strengths and virtues. Aim: The study investigated the factor structure of character strengths measure as well as well as demographic correlates of the virtues in a Hungarian sample. Method: Participants in three self-reported questionnaire-based online cross-sectional studies (σn = 10,911) filled in the VIA-H, the Global Well-being Scale, Huppert s and Diener s flourishing scales, the Positivity Scale, and the Shortened Psychological Immune Competence questionnaire. Results: The exploratory factor analysis and the confirmatory factor analyzes performed on the subsamples and on the pooled sample, provided evidence for four factors (eigenvalues: 10.82, 1.68, 1.21, and 1.09; cumulative explained variance ratio: 61.55%): Wisdom and Knowledge, Humanity, Temperance, Spirituality and Transcendence. The four scales showed excellent internal consistency values in each study (Cronbach-α and McDonald-ω values between 0.738 and 0.885). The confirmatory factor analyzes performed on the subsamples showed a good fit with the four-factor model. Results proved low discriminant (43% unique part) but excellent content validity (rS > 0,5). Participants rated themselves highest on Humanity and lowest on Temperance. Women gave significantly higher values for Humanity (d(3756.0) =-15.641, p < 0.001, Cohen s d = 0.378) and Spirituality and Transcendence virtue scales (d(3900.9) =-12.394, p < 0.001, Cohen s d = 0.293) than men. The virtue of Wisdom and knowledge showed a positive relationship with the level of education (rS = 0.211, p < 0.001).

  abstract={The strength named “social intelligence” in the Values in Action (VIA) Classification of Character Strengths and Virtues represents emotional, personal, and social intelligences, which are considered “hot intelligences”. This work contributed to the study of the mechanisms of influence of social intelligence on mental health. A multiple mediation model was proposed to quantify the direct effect of social intelligence on psychopathological symptoms, as well as its indirect effect through its impact on components of subjective and psychological well-being. This study involved 1407 university students who completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Psychological Well-Being Scales (PWBS), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Social intelligence was found to be significantly associated with life satisfaction (a = 0.33, p < 0.001), positive affect (a = 0.42, p < 0.001), and negative affect (a = -0.21, p < 0.001), transmitting significant indirect effects on psychopathological symptomatology through these components of subjective well-being. Likewise, social intelligence was positively and significantly related to psychological well-being (a-paths ranged from 0.31 to 0.43, p < 0.001), exerting significant and negative indirect effects on psychological distress through the dimension of positive relations with other people. These results could be useful in order to expand the explanatory models of the influence of social intelligence on mental health and to design interventions based on this strength for the promotion of well-being and the reduction in psychological distress. © 2020 by the authors.},

  abstract={The World Health Organization (WHO) encourages using evidence-based traditional yoga and meditation practices for the promotion of mental health and well-being. This study intends to examine the influence of three Indian meditation practices, i.e., Vipassana mindfulness meditation, Raja Yoga and Sudarshan Kriya Yoga, by employing a cross-sectional design. 168 healthy adults-84 meditators (n=28 for each practice) and 84 non-meditators – had voluntarily participated. Meditators reported significantly higher subjective well-being (satisfaction with life, positive affect), psychological well-being (flourishing), presence of meaning in life, and character strengths (hope, gratitude, curiosity, zest and love), and significantly lower negative affect as compared to non-meditators. The medium to large effect sizes (Cohen’s d:.572 to.955), except for zest, were marked with a significant association (rp: |.245 to.487|, p<.05) with the duration of meditation, thereby signifying enhanced benefits of sustained practice. 60.2% of the variance in flourishing was explained by satisfaction in life, positive affect, hope, gratitude and presence of meaning.

  abstract={Previous studies have shown that personality types may lead to different health status. The current study aims to refine a previous typological profile of strength using a heterogeneous sample (N = 5776) and clarify further the associations between strength profiles and mental wellbeing (e.g., flourishing), mental illbeing (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stress), strength knowledge, and strength use. Latent profile analysis was implemented to distinguish subgroups on the basis of the three-dimensional inventory of character strengths (e.g., self-control, inquisitiveness, and caring). Results refined previous findings and indicated three specific profiles, namely, Strength, Common, and Risk Groups. The Strength Group scored relatively high on self-control and inquisitiveness but low on caring; the Common Group scored relatively high on caring; and the Risk Group had relatively high scores on self-control. As expected, the Strength Group had the highest strength knowledge and strength use, whereas the Risk Group had the least strength knowledge and strength use. The three proposed profiles have significant differences of anxiety, stress, and flourishing; however, the difference of depression between the Strength and Risk Groups was insignificant compared with the Common Group. This study can be helpful in refining strength typologies for future effective strength-based interventions. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

  abstract={Research has shown that people sometimes report self-perceived growth as a result of dealing with a potentially traumatic event, but relatively few methodologically rigorous studies have examined whether perceived posttraumatic growth is associated with improved subsequent well-being across a wide range of outcomes. In this three-wave longitudinal study of Colombian emerging adults (n = 636), we examined the associations of perceived posttraumatic growth with 17 well-being outcomes across domains of psychological well-being (i.e., self-rated mental health, meaning in life, sense of purpose, happiness, life satisfaction), psychological distress (i.e., anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, subjective suffering), social well-being (i.e., content with relationships, satisfying relationships, loneliness), physical well-being (i.e., self-rated physical health, sleep quality), and character strengths (i.e., state hope, trait forgivingness, orientation to promote good, delayed gratification). Using an outcome-wide analytic design that adjusted for a range of covariates assessed in Wave 1, we found that overall perceived posttraumatic growth assessed in Wave 2 was robustly associated with improvements in one or more facet of each well-being domain (15/17 outcomes in total) assessed approximately six months later in Wave 3. Our findings suggest that perceived posttraumatic growth may contribute to individual well-being over the longer-term. Copyright © 2022 Chen, Bechara, Cowden and Worthington.},

  abstract={Character strengths are positively valued traits that are expected to contribute to the good life (Peterson and Seligman 2004). Numerous studies have confirmed their robust relationships with subjective or hedonic well-being. Seligman (2011) provided a new framework of well-being suggesting five dimensions that encompass both hedonic and eudemonic aspects of well-being: positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning and accomplishment (forming the acronym PERMA). However, the role of character strengths has not been studied so far in this framework. Also, most studies on the relationships between character strengths and well-being only have only relied on self-reports. This set of two studies examines the relationships of character strengths and the orientations to well-being in two cross-sectional studies (Study 1: N = 5521), while also taking informant-reports into account and utilizing different questionnaires to control for a possible method bias (Study 2: N = 172). Participants completed validated assessments of character strengths and the PERMA dimensions (self-reports in Study 1, self- and informant-reports in Study 2). Results showed that in self-reports, all strengths were positively related to all PERMA dimensions, but there were differences in the size of the relationships. Accomplishment, for example, showed the strongest associations with strengths such as perspective, persistence, and zest, whereas for positive relationships, strengths such as teamwork, love, and kindness were the best predictors. These findings were largely confirmed by informant-reports in Study 2. The findings provide further support for the notion that character contributes to well-being and they could guide the development of strengths-based interventions tailored to individual needs. © 2019, The International Society for Quality-of-Life Studies (ISQOLS) and Springer Nature B.V.},

  abstract={In most of their work settings, the health and well-being of hospital physicians are at risk. Trends of work intensification and changing laws in the European Union and beyond have heightened the call for taking a closer look at the workplace and training conditions of hospital physicians. This study aims to identify specific work characteristics (such as autonomy, social support, cognitive demands, and skill adequacy), in order to determine conditions for the applicability of individual character strengths at work and in turn for increased work engagement and well-being. We examined our hypotheses based on cross-sectional (N = 173) and longitudinal self-report data (N = 72) of hospital physicians in Austria. The results identified significant indirect effects of skill adequacy, cognitive demands, autonomy, and social support at work – via the applicability of individual character strengths at work – on work engagement and general well-being. Longitudinal analyses additionally confirmed autonomy as a thriving work characteristic for promoting the applicability of individual character strengths over time (time lag: 6 months). This study revealed the value of enabling and preserving the applicability of character strengths in a hospital work setting and focused – for the first time – on its predicting work characteristics. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of securing skill adequacy early in the training of young physicians and encouraging, as well as, sustaining autonomy in their daily work life. © 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: The present study aimed to develop and validate the Character Strengths Test 24 (CST24), a simple scale consisting of 24 character strengths represented by one concept word and one sentence each. Three studies were conducted to examine the validation and utility of the CST24 for future research. Methods: Three internet-based surveys were conducted in Japan to investigate the psychometric properties of the CST24. Study 1 comprised 846 adults and focused on test development, including the evaluation of well-being and strengths scales, as well as retest reliability. Study 2 involved 1137 high school students and 1101 college undergraduates, aiming to investigate the factor structure of the CST24 and reaffirm its validity by utilizing happiness and meaning in life scales. In Study 3, 524 working adults participated to explore the scale's potential for future research. This study incorporated various psychological scales, such as value orientation, moral foundation, and work-related scales, to assess the utility of the CST24. Results: In Study 1, the CST24 items exhibited a well-distributed response pattern, demonstrating favorable retest reliability and internal consistency. Significant positive correlations were found between the CST24 items and measures of subjective well-being, meaning in life, positive self-compassion, and knowledge or utilization of strengths. Study 2 confirmed the stability of the factor structure across diverse sample groups, consistent with prior studies utilizing larger-scale measures. Study 3 identified both core and peripheral strengths, highlighting specific strengths that made substantial contributions to well-being, value orientation, moral foundation, sense of mission, and work-related indices through multiple regression analysis. Conclusion: The findings support the reliability and validity of the CST24 as a concise assessment tool for measuring 24 character strengths. Its potential utility for screening and exploratory research warrants attention in future studies, enhancing our understanding of the role of character strengths in various domains. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

This study analyzes the relationship between character strengths and life satisfaction in Spanish women diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods: A sample of 117 women completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Spanish version of the VIA Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS). Correlation analysis and regression modeling were performed to determine which strengths predict life satisfaction. Results: The results of the correlation analysis showed that 15 strengths were positively and significantly associated with life satisfaction, with the highest correlations corresponding to zest, hope, curiosity, social intelligence, love, gratitude, and judgment. Regression modeling indicated that of these, zest and hope were key strengths for predicting life satisfaction. Conclusions: These findings suggest that intervention programs based on the development of zest and hope could help to improve life satisfaction and, therefore, the psychological well-being of women with breast cancer. © The Author(s) 2023.},

  abstract={Enhancing the well-being of primary and post-primary students is one of the priorities of the Department of Education and Skills in Ireland. Whilst interventions are being implemented across the board, little is known about the current levels of adolescents’ well-being. Drawing from research on positive education, in the current study well-being was assessed amongst 2822 adolescents, aged 12–19 in Ireland, using the PERMA profiler [Butler, J., and M. L. Kern. (2016). “The PERMA-Profiler: A Brief Multidimensional Measure of Flourishing.” International Journal of Wellbeing 6 (3): 1–48. doi:10.5502/ijw.v6i3.526] and “VIA-Youth Survey” [VIA Character (2014). http://www.viacharacter.org/www/Research-Old2/Psychometric-Data-VIA-Youth-Survey]. Mann–Whitney U-test and multiple regression analyses were conducted in the examination of age and sex differences in students’ well-being scores, and the prediction of the contribution of character-strength-development to well-being. The results showed that students’ well-being decreased steadily from the first year, through to the middle and senior years of post-primary school. Furthermore, in comparison to males, females reported lower levels of well-being across the board, and higher levels of negative emotions and loneliness. Finally, the underuse of character strengths predicted lower levels of well-being in Irish schools. Implications for practice include the importance of customising well-being programmes across different schools and age groups, as well as the potential for the incorporation of psychological tests to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions. © 2019, © 2019 Educational Studies Association of Ireland.},

  abstract={Background: Most people who survive suicide attempts neither re-attempt suicide nor die by suicide. Research on suicide attempt survivors has primarily focused on negative endpoints (e.g., increased suicide risk) rather than positive outcomes. One important outcome is psychological well-being (PWB), defined as positive functioning across emotional, intrapersonal, and interpersonal domains. We compared PWB among US military veterans with (i.e., attempt survivors) and without (i.e., non-attempters) a history of suicide attempt(s) using data from three nationally representative cohorts. Methods: Each US veteran cohort (Cohort1: N = 3148; Cohort2: N = 1474; Cohort3: N = 4042) completed measures of suicidality (e.g., attempt history), character strengths (e.g., curiosity, optimism), psychological symptoms (e.g., depression), and indicators of PWB (e.g., happiness). t-Tests were conducted to examine group differences in PWB; hierarchical regressions were conducted to examine suicide attempt status as a predictor of PWB controlling for symptoms and demographics. Multivariable regressions were conducted to identify predictors of PWB among attempt survivors. Results: In each cohort, reported PWB was markedly lower among suicide attempt survivors than non-attempters (ds = 0.9–1.2), even after adjusting for mental health symptoms. Individual differences in PWB were observed, with a subset of suicide attempt survivors reporting higher PWB levels than non-attempters (1.4–7.4 %). Curiosity and optimism were positively associated with PWB among suicide attempt survivors (rs = 0.60–0.78). Limitations: Data were cross-sectional, limiting inferences about causation and directionality of associations. Conclusions: Findings highlight diminished PWB as an important and understudied concern among veteran attempt survivors. Collectively, our findings underscore the importance of considering PWB in the research, assessment, and treatment of suicidality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={The original Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) is an international 240 item validated self-report questionnaire measuring character strengths. A validated and reliable English 120-item short form (VIA-120) is available. However, there is limited information about the psychometric properties of the German VIA-120. This article addresses this gap and reports the reliability, validity and comparability of the German VIA-120 with the German VIA-240 version. Two independent samples were recruited: a general population sample (N = 1073, Sample 1) and a sample consisting of medical students and physicians (N = 685, Sample 2). Internal consistency of the VIA-120-scales ranged from α =.58 (modesty) to α =.87 (spirituality) in Sample 1 and α =.63 (honesty) to α =.90 (spirituality) in Sample 2. Intercorrelations between the scales of the 120-item version and the original 240-Items version (Sample 1) ranged from r =.52 (hope) to r =.89 (prudence). Criterion validity with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Brief Inventory of Thriving (BIT) was demonstrated. The comparison of the factor structure between the original and the short form showed a good convergence (Tucker’s Phi.93–.99 Sample 1,.95–.98 Sample 2). Overall, the German VIA-120 was reliable, showed good convergence with the German VIA-240 and thus presents a similar level of validity for the assessment of character strengths. This study provides the first indication that the VIA 120 short form is comparable regarding the validity and reliability of the original VIA 240-item version indicating its potential to be used in large scale research studies. © 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the major health problems across the world that poses a great threat to human health and active life in all age groups, causing numerous personal, familial, and social damages in physical, mental and spiritual dimensions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of positive psychotherapy on happiness, character strengths, pleasure, commitment, and semantic measures in the lives of people with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within the framework of a quasi-experimental design, 58 patients suffering from cancer meeting the inclusion criteria (disease history and married) were selected via purposeful sampling method. However, only 30 of the patients met the required criteria to participate in all psychotherapy sessions. The participants were then randomly assigned to two intervention and control groups (15 participants per group). The intervention group received eight 120-min sessions of positive psychotherapy on a weekly basis while the control group was put on the waiting list. Data collection tools included the Oxford Happiness-Depression Questionnaire and Values in Action-Inventory of Strengths. The participants completed the questionnaires before and after the intervention. Data analysis was conducted by analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The results of covariance analysis suggested that the use of positive psychotherapy has been effective on increasing happiness (F = 0.129, P = 0.005), increasing character strength (F = 27.55, P = 0.001), increasing the semantic measures (F = 15.23, P = 0.002), increasing pleasure (F = 8.51, P = 0.005), and commitment (F = 64.19, P = 0.001) among patients with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicated that positive psychotherapy has been effective on happiness, strengths, pleasure, commitment, and semantic measures of the life among people with cancer. Positive psychotherapy can be used to minimize the effects of cancer on patients. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Theoretical propositions suggesting that character strengths (CSs) may have darker sides have triggered a new wave of studies, providing novel insight into the role that misuse of CSs play in psychopathology. Pioneering research in the field has addressed the challenge of constructing an instrument for measuring over/under/optimal use of CSs, and explaining the role of specific strengths’ underuse or overuse in social anxiety disorder. The present study sought to continue this line of research by examining the role of specific strengths’ underuse-overuse in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). An international sample of 970 adults completed online questionnaires derived from a CSs website. We first replicated findings that general CSs’ underuse and overuse were associated with negative outcomes, while optimal use was related to positive outcomes. Second, we found obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) to be associated with the overuse of social intelligence, judgment, appreciation of beauty and excellence, fairness, perseverance, and prudence, as well as with underuse of forgiveness, self-regulation, curiosity, and creativity. Using simultaneous regression, the noted misuse of strengths, not including the overuse of perseverance and the underuse of curiosity and creativity, accounted for almost a quarter of the variance in OCS. Using discriminant analysis, the combination of the overuse of social intelligence, judgment, appreciation of beauty and excellence, fairness, and prudence, as well as the underuse of forgiveness and self-regulation, successfully re-sorted 89.3% of the participants into those that do and do not have clinical levels of OCD. These findings provide support to the role of strengths misuse in psychopathology. © 2019, The International Society for Quality-of-Life Studies (ISQOLS) and Springer Nature B.V.},

Peterson and Seligman developed a classification of strengths identifying 24 character strengths assumed to be important to well-being. Yet, few studies have comprehensively investigated the implications of possessing the character strengths. In this study 759 college students completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths scale (VIA-IS) to test the relationship between character strengths and various measures of well-being. The well-being measures included: satisfaction with life, happiness, resiliency, positive and negative affect, physical health, GPA, SAT/ACT scores, physical health, depression, anxiety, eating problems, alcohol consumption, drug use, and risky behaviors. Character strengths were most strongly related to positive measures of well-being (e.g., zest/enthusiasm); the next highest relationship was with the four measures of academic achievement, but there was only moderate relationships to psychopathology and very low association to physical health.

  abstract={Objective: To investigate the influence of character strengths on adolescent depressive symptoms and regulatory effect of gender and age. Methods: From April to July in 2011, using VIA-Youth and CES-D, we conducted measurement of character strengths and depression level on 70 628 adolescents enrolled from 10 sample provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the administration of central government (Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian, Chongqing, Guangxi, Inner Mongolia and Anhui) and one sample city (Shijiazhuang). The number of effective subjects was 47 872. The regulatory effect of gender and age on the relationship between character strengths and adolescent depression symptoms was investigated using multi-level multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: The score of character strengths of adolescents was (719.31 ± 84.06), and the score of depression symptom was (14.64 ± 10.08). The score of depression symptom and age had positive correlation (r =0.097, P <0.001), while gender and character strengths had negative correlation (r values were -0.026 and -0.489; P < 0.001). character strengths had a backward prediction of depression symptom (β =-0.495, P <0.001). Gender had no regulatory effect on the relationship between character strengths and depression symptom (β =-0.007, P =0.095). Age had regulatory effect on the relationship between character strengths and depression symptom (β =-0.056, P <0.001). Conclusion: Character strengths alleviates depression of adolescents, and its effect is more obvious among adolescents with higher age. Copyright © 2016 by the Chinese General Practice.},

  abstract={This pilot study investigates spiritual development as progressing in accordance with chakra theory. Chakra theory posits that spirituality emerges in a developmental monotonic fashion with increasing degrees of connection and spiritual awareness. People further into the progression generally show greater mental health and stronger character virtues, while individuals in earlier stages of development show greater pathology and lower levels of character virtues. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used in a sample of 1633 adults from the United States to empirically derive five profiles of spiritual connection, which reflected the monotonic progression predicted by the chakra theory. Participants who were low on all five variables of spiritual connection (3% of participants) were labeled the "Disconnected" class, and participants who were high on all five variables were labeled the "Highly Connected" class (16% of participants). The Disconnected class showed the greatest psychopathology (depressive and anxious symptoms) and lowest levels of positive psychology traits (gratitude, grit, satisfaction with life, selfcompassion, and flourishing), while the Highly Connected class showed the lowest psychopathology and highest levels of positive psychology traits. The other three classes, which fell between the Disconnected class and the Highly Connected class, carried intermediate levels of psychopathology and character strengths. Findings support future investigation on a universal progression of spiritual development based upon chakra theory. © 2016 Jennifer Drapkin et al., published by De Gruyter Open.},

  abstract={Several studies link attachment insecurities with lower levels of life satisfaction. Positive psychology studies link character strengths, especially those associated with social interactions (i.e., love and gratitude) or optimism (hope and zest), with higher levels of life satisfaction. We hypothesized that the negative associations between insecure attachment and life satisfaction is mediated by low endorsement of such strengths. In this study 394 individuals completed the ECR measure of attachment orientations, the VIA-IS measure of virtues and character strengths, and the SWLS measure of life satisfaction. Results showed that most strengths were negatively associated with both avoidant and anxious attachment orientations. A bootstrapping procedure revealed that: (a) Love, zest, gratitude and hope fully mediated the association between avoidance and lower life satisfaction. (b) Hope, curiosity and perspective partially mediated the association between attachment anxiety and life satisfaction. These findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying life satisfaction are different for avoidant and for anxious individuals, although hope is prevalent for both attachment orientations. The theoretical and clinical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract={Purpose: Studies that focus on the development of the typology of individual strength profiles are limited. Thus, this study aimed to determine strength profiles with different health outcomes based on the Three-Dimensional Inventory of Character Strengths (TICS). Methods: The TICS was used to measure three-dimensional strengths: caring, inquisitiveness, and self-control. A total of 3536 community participants (1322 males and 2214 females with ages ranging from 17 to 50, M = 23.96, SD = 5.13) completed the TICS. A subsample (n = 853; female = 68.2%, male = 31.8%) was further required to complete the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and Flourishing Scale. A latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted in the total sample to identify the latent strength profiles. Then, a three-step method was implemented to compare the mental health outcomes between strength profiles in the subsample. Results: The LPA helped determine two subgroups based on the entire sample: the at-strengths group (high scores on all dimensions) and the at-risk group (low scores on all dimensions). As expected, the at-strengths group had less significant negative emotional symptoms (at-strengths group = 0.57, at-risk group = 0.83, χ2 = 33.54, p <.001) and had better psychological well-being (at-strengths group = 5.81, at-risk group = 4.64, χ2 = 276.64, p <.001). Conclusions: This study identified two character strength profiles with different health outcomes. Specifically, populations with low-character strengths (caring, inquisitiveness, and self-control) were more likely to demonstrate poor mental health outcomes. Our findings also showed that a particular trait subtype can be considered in identifying high-risk populations and further implementing targeted strength-based interventions. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={Aim. The aim of the study was to assess the character strengths of people with schizophrenia and their importance in building life satisfaction, and also to identify differences and similarities in the character strengths between people with schizophrenia and healthy people. Methods. 40 people with diagnosed schizophrenia and 40 healthy people participated in the study. Each participant was examined with the following tools: Socio-Demographic Data Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), International Personality Item Pool – Values in Action (IPIP-VIA).; Results. People with schizophrenia achieved significantly lower scores than those in the control group in terms of such strengths of character like: hope, humor, self-regulation, citizenship, leadership, capacity for love, kindness, social/emotional intelligence, bravery, industry, integrity, zest, curiosity, love of learning, perspective/wisdom. People with schizophrenia are also different from healthy people in terms of experiencing life satisfaction. At the same time, they do not differ in such strengths of character as: originality, judgment, fairness, forgiveness/mercy, modesty/humility, prudence, appreciation for beauty, gratitude, spirituality. The character strengths of people in the clinical group (more often than in the control group) are associated with the sense of life satisfaction. In older people suffering from schizophrenia, many strengths of their character are reduced. Conclusions. People with schizophrenia are different from those in the control group in terms of 15 strengths. They are also less satisfied with their lives. Experiencing life satisfaction of people with schizophrenia is associated with a complex configuration of strengths. © 2019 Polish Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Background: Several studies have examined sleep quality in the post renal transplant population of China, but few studies have actually confirmed the related psychosocial variables of sleep quality in renal transplant recipients with home care. Objectives: This study investigates sleep quality and its related psychosocial variables among renal transplant patients. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study using a convenient sampling approach. Self-report questionnaires were applied to 485 renal transplant patients. All participants completed the General Data Questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Self-Rating Depression Scale, the Three-Dimensional Inventory of Character Strengths, and the Flourishing Scale. Results: A total of 438 valid questionnaires were included in the analysis. The global PSQI score was 5.86 (SD, 3.20), significantly lower than the norm; 128 (29.2%) recipients were classified as having poor sleep quality (global PSQI > 7). In the component score of PSQI, sleep onset latency was the highest; the others from high to low are sleep disturbance, daytime dysfunction, subjective sleep quality, sleep efficiency, sleep duration, and use of hypnotic medication. A total of 19.6% reported sleeping fewer than 6 hours a night, 64.8% reported that they had to get up to use the bathroom, and 50.0% woke up in the middle of the night or early morning at least 1 night per week in the past month. Significant differences in the PSQI scores were observed in renal transplant patients of different sex, age, residence, career, length of post–renal transplant period, comorbidity, kidney function, and depressive symptoms (P <.05). The PSQI scores were positively correlated with depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale) (P <.01) but negatively correlated with inquisitiveness (Three-Dimensional Inventory of Character Strengths–inquisitiveness) and psychological well-being (Flourishing Scale) (P <.01). Conclusion: The sleep quality of renal transplant patients was lower than that of the general population. Character strengths and well-being can increase the level of sleep quality in renal transplant patients. Psychosocial intervention is necessary for improving the sleep quality of renal transplant recipients in China. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Although research on character strengths has flourished in recent years, the paucity of suitable quantitative instruments for the assessment of children's character strengths limits the study of character development in childhood. The Character Strengths Inventory for Children (CSI-C) is a new self-report character inventory for children that was designed for easy administration directly to elementary school-aged children. The CSI-C provides an evaluation of 24 character strengths defined in Peterson and Seligman's Values in Action Classification of Strengths. Data from two samples of 2,061 Israeli children aged 7-12 support the constructs of the instrument. Principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis of the 96 CSI-C items revealed preliminary evidence for a hierarchical structure with 24 lower factors nested within four higher-order latent factors: interpersonal, transcendence, intellectual, and temperance strengths. Children's interpersonal and temperance strengths were negatively associated with mental health difficulties, and their temperance and transcendence strengths were positively associated with subjective well-being. The intellectual and temperance strengths were correlated with children's school functioning and grit. The potential uses of the CSI-C in research and practice are discussed. © 2018 Shoshani and Shwartz.},

  abstract={Despite the flourishing of positive education, understanding of whether different character strengths have different predictive effects on academic achievement/well-being and the mechanisms of actions between character strengths are limited. Specifically, this study adopted strength use as a mediator to understand how character strength (assessed by caring, inquisitiveness, and self-control) is associated with students’ end-of-year academic achievements and eudaimonic well-being. Survey data from 349 adolescents from three different schools showed that three factors of character strengths have positive correlations with academic achievements and eudaimonic well-being. Regression models indicated that inquisitiveness and self-control predicted academic achievements, while caring, inquisitiveness, and self-control predicted eudaimonic well-being, with the foremost as the strongest predictor. Mediation analyses indicated that (1) strengths use fully mediated the relationship between inquisitiveness, self-control, and academic achievements/eudaimonic well-being, while (2) caring had a direct effect on eudaimonic well-being. These findings provided possible explanations on how character strengths could affect students’ academic achievements or eudaimonic well-being and theoretical and empirical evidence for practices that aim to enhance students’ academic achievements and positive developments via interventions based on character strengths. © 2019 Tang, Li, Duan, Mu and Cheng.},

  abstract={Background: Positive psychology studies what is best in people. In their classification of strengths and virtues, Peterson and Seligman [11] assign humor to the virtue of transcendence. Thus far, there is no specific study that deals with age-related changes in humor (as a strength of character) across a lifespan and its relation to well-being in the elderly. Participants and methods: A total of n=42,964 participants completed an online questionnaire on humor as a strength of character. Participants also completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Orientations to Happiness Scale. Results: In a cross-sectional design, the scores for humor decreased until the age of 50. Men between 51 and 62 years had higher scores; there was a trend for women older than 70 to score higher (but this was not statistically significant). Humor was robustly positively correlated with life satisfaction, as well with a pleasurable and an engaged life, but was lowest with a meaningful life. The oldest participants had the lowest (yet still meaningful) correlation coefficients (with the exception of a meaningful life). Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of humor across the lifespan and underlines the importance of studies among the elderly within a framework of positive psychology. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

  abstract={Mindfulness and character strengths significantly contribute to psychological wellbeing in various contexts. Empirical studies further imply that mindfulness-based interventions can cultivate a wide range of strengths, which in turn facilitate the wellbeing of individuals. However, no study has examined this hypothesis. The current study underpins this argument with empirical pieces of evidence from cross-sectional (Study 1) and longitudinal (Study 2) data by investigating the relationship between character strengths, mindfulness, and psychological wellbeing among community (n = 375) and undergraduate populations (n = 229). Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Brief Strengths Scale, and Flourishing Scale were administrated. As hypothesized, the results of the cross-sectional investigation confirm that mindfulness and character strengths are conceptually related constructs with significant contributions to psychological wellbeing. Temperance Strength and Interpersonal Strength further mediate the relationship between Observing facet of mindfulness and Flourishing. Furthermore, investigating the relationship among mindfulness, strengths, and psychological wellbeing using Longitudinal Mediation Modeling reveals a clear picture. After the baseline of the outcomes is controlled, the 6-month longitudinal study indicates that the past level of Observing facet of mindfulness can predict the present level of Temperance Strength, which in turn predicts future Flourishing. These results highlight the importance of Observing facet in mindfulness and Temperance Strength, which provide another possible explanation on how and why mindfulness can affect psychological wellbeing among general populations. Future Strength-based Mindfulness Intervention Programs can be developed based on these findings. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

They are also hypothesized to contribute to the growth and flourishing of individuals and organizations. However, their associations with work performance and counterproductive work behaviors have rarely been studied. The present study seeks to identify character strengths most highly associated with work performance and counterproductive work behaviors and explores the role of individuals’ sense of meaning at work and work orientation in mediating these associations. An international sample (N = 686) completed the measures of strengths endorsement, work performance, counterproductive work behaviors, sense of meaning at work, and work orientation. Results pointed to perseverance as most highly associated with work performance and most negatively associated with counterproductive work behaviors. These associations were mediated by working individuals’ sense of meaning at work and perceptions of work as a career and as a calling. These findings highlight the contribution of perseverance to work performance and counterproductive behaviors, beyond the role of other character strengths, and highlight work meaningfulness and work orientation as psychological mechanisms underlying its effects. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

  abstract={Class clowns traditionally were studied as a type concept and identified via sociometric procedures. In the present study a variable-centered approach was favored and class clown behaviors were studied in the context of character strengths, orientations to happiness and satisfaction with life. A sample of 672 Swiss children and adolescents filled in an 18 item self-report instrument depicting class clown behaviors. A hierarchical model of class clown behaviors was developed distinguishing a general factor and the four positively correlated dimensions of "identified as a class clown," "comic talent," "disruptive rule-breaker," and "subversive joker." Analysis of the general factor showed that class clowns were primarily male, and tended to be seen as class clowns by the teacher. Analyses of the 24 character strengths of the VIA-Youth (Park & Peterson, 2006) showed that class clowns were high in humor and leadership, and low in strengths like prudence, self-regulation, modesty, honesty, fairness, perseverance, and love of learning. An inspection of signature strengths revealed that 75% of class clowns had humor as a signature strength. Furthermore, generally class clown behaviors were shown by students indulging in a life of pleasure, but low life of engagement. The four dimensions yielded different character strengths profiles. While all dimensions of class clowns behaviors were low in temperance strengths, the factors "identified as the class clown" and "comic talent" were correlated with leadership strengths and the two negative factors ("disruptive rule-breaker", "subversive joker") were low in other directed strengths. The disruptive rule breaking class clown was additionally low in intellectual strengths. While humor predicted life satisfaction, class clowning tended to go along with diminished satisfaction with life. It is concluded that different types of class clowns need to be kept apart and need different attention by teachers. © 2014 Ruch, Platt and Hofmann.},

  abstract={Research has shown that character strengths are positively linked with well-being in general. However, there has not been a fine-grained analysis up to date. This study examines the individual relational aspects between the 24 character strengths, subjective well-being (SWB), and different aspects of psychological well-being (PWB) at two times of measurement (N = 117). Results showed that overall the "good character" was significantly stronger related with PWB than with SWB. The character strength "hope" was at least moderately correlated with the PWB aspects meaning, optimism and autonomy, and "zest" with the PWB aspects relationships and engagement. "Persistence" showed the highest correlation with the PWB aspect mastery. Out of the 24 character strengths, the happiness-related strengths (hope, zest, gratitude, curiosity, and love) were more likely to correlate with PWB and SWB than any other character strength. This study offers a more fine-grained and thorough understanding of specific relational aspects between the 24 character strengths and a broad range of well-being aspects. Future studies should take up a detailed strategy when exploring relationships between character strengths and well-being. © 2017 Hausler, Strecker, Huber, Brenner, Höge and Höfer.},

  abstract={The multidimensional PERMA-H positive education model provided evaluation and education framework for the theoretical and practice development of positive psychology in schools. Character strengths use mediates the association of strength knowledge and well-being. Using the Assessment Program for Affective and Social Outcomes (2nd Version) (APASO-II), the Subjective Happiness Scale, and the Physical Health Subscale of the PERMA-profiler, a multidimensional measure of PERMA-H was validated using confirmatory factor analysis in the context of a positive education program evaluation in senior primary school students. The association of PERMA-H measurements with school well-being as measured by general satisfaction of school life, and levels of depression and anxiety, and the mediation mechanism of character strengths use in such association were studied using path analysis. A cross-sectional sample of 726 senior primary school students (i.e., grade 4-6) aged 8-13 from the two primary schools completed a baseline evaluation questionnaire of a positive education program. Satisfactory internal reliability of the scales was obtained with Cronbach's alpha coefficients < 0.70. The scales were generally positively and moderately inter-correlated, except for level of anxiety and depression symptoms which was negative. Good psychometric properties of APASO-II were evidenced from the factor structure of sub-scale scores conforming to six factors of the PERMA-H model by confirmatory factor analysis. Path analyses showed that the APASO-II factors together with measures of subject happiness and positive health as the multidimensional PERMA-H model of positive education differentially predicted general satisfaction of school life, level of anxiety and depression, and character strengths use. Character strengths use mediated the relationship of Positive Engagement with general satisfaction of school life. Positive education utilizes knowledge and research findings from positive psychology in schools to produce intended positive outcomes like enhanced well-being and reduced level of depression in students. This study provided a solid foundation for related scientific research and the understanding of the multidimensional framework of positive psychology concepts. Systematic promotion and longitudinal evaluation of positive education at the institutional level in Hong Kong can be achieved with the use of APASO-II and the positive education scales of subjective happiness and physical health. © 2018 Lai, Leung, Kwok, Hui, Lo, Leung and Tam.},

  abstract={Recent years have seen an increasing interest in research in positive psychology interventions. There is broad evidence for their effectiveness in increasing well-being and ameliorating depression. Intentional activities that focus on those character strengths, which are most typical for a person (i.e., signature strengths) and encourage their usage in a new way have been identified as highly effective. The current study aims at comparing an intervention aimed at using signature strengths with one on using individual low scoring (or lesser) strengths in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. A total of 375 adults were randomly assigned to one of the two intervention conditions (i.e., using five signature vs. five lesser strengths in a new way) or a placebo control condition (i.e., early memories). We measured happiness and depressive symptoms at five time points (i.e., pre- and post-test, 1-, 3-, and 6-months follow-ups) and character strengths at pre-test. The main findings are that (1) there were increases in happiness for up to three months and decreased depressive symptoms in the short term in both intervention conditions; (2) participants found working with strengths equally rewarding (enjoyment and benefit) in both conditions; (3) those participants that reported generally higher levels of strengths benefitted more from working on lesser strengths rather than signature strengths and those with comparatively lower levels of strengths tended to benefit more from working on signature strengths; and (4) deviations from an average profile derived from a large sample of German-speakers completing the Values-in-Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) were associated with greater benefit from the interventions in the signature strengths intervention. We conclude that working on character strengths is effective for increasing happiness and discuss how these interventions could be tailored to the individual for promoting their effectiveness. © 2015 Proyer, Gander, Wellenzohn and Ruch.},

A sample of 334 Swiss adults completed questionnaires and collected informant ratings by 634 peers. Self- and peer ratings converged well and suggest that, primarily: the strengths of hope, zest, and curiosity - but also gratitude and love - play key roles in the interplay of strengths and satisfaction with life. Peer ratings of strengths also related positively with the endorsement of a pleasurable, engaged, and meaningful life. Further analyses show that the OTH predict satisfaction with life beyond self- and peer-rated character strengths. There, the engaged life (i.e. endorsement of flow) was most relevant. This study supports earlier findings that argue for an important role of character strengths when describing the well-being of a person. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The present research extends previous findings by comparing satisfaction with life and character strengths of non-religious people, religious people, who practice their religion and people that have a religious affiliation but do not practice their religion. We assessed life satisfaction (SWLS), character strengths (VIA-IS) and the orientations to happiness (OTH) in a sample of N =3D 20538 participants. People with a religious affiliation that also practice their religion were found to be more satisfied with their life and scored higher on life of meaning than those who do not practice their religion and than non-religious people. Also religious people who practice their religion differed significantly from those who do not practice their religion and non-religious people regarding several character strengths; they scored higher on kindness, love, gratitude, hope, forgiveness, and on spirituality. There were no substantial differences between people who had no religious affiliation and those with a religious affiliation that do not practice their religion (all ηp2s < 0.009). Altogether, the present findings suggest that people profit from a religious affiliation if they also actively practice their religion. © 2014 Berthold and Ruch.},

  abstract={Signature strengths are individuals’ highest-ranked strengths, those that they own, celebrate, and frequently exercise. Their use has been theorized to elicit positive affect, and contribute significantly to individuals’ functioning and well-being. The present study examined two elements of these ideas in the work arena: (a) Associations of strengths use at work with work outcomes (work meaningfulness, engagement, job satisfaction, performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and counterproductive work behaviors), focusing on differences in the associations of signature-strengths use, lowest-strengths use, and happiness strengths-use at work; (b) The role of positive affect in mediating these associations. The results, based on self-reports of an international sample of 1031 working individuals, generally indicated that the use of all kinds of strengths had positive correlates. As expected, using signature strengths had the highest, robust unique contribution to behavioral outcomes (performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and lower counterproductive work behavior). But unexpectedly, using happiness strengths (and not signature strengths) had the highest, robust unique contribution to psycho-emotional work-related outcomes (work meaningfulness, engagement, and job satisfaction). Positive affect mediated the association between strengths use and all work-related outcomes for the three kinds of strengths, when each was examined separately. However, when uses of the three kinds of strengths were examined together, positive affect mediated the effects of lowest strengths use and those of happiness strengths use, but not the effects of signature strengths use. These findings highlight the differential benefits of using different kinds of strengths, and suggest that additional (and different) mechanisms may underlie these effects. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract={We investigated relations among strengths of character in 881 students from Croatian universities. We also examined links between strengths and various well-being indices. Our conceptualization was based on the Values in Action classification system with 24 strengths organized within six superordinate virtues (Peterson & Seligman, 2004). A factor analysis led to a four-factor solution; factors were defined as Interpersonal Strengths, Fortitude, Vitality, and Cautiousness. Of these factors, Vitality (with zest, hope, curiosity, and humor as indicators) emerged as the most relevant to well-being. When examining individual strengths, zest, curiosity, gratitude, and optimism/hope emerged with the strongest associations with elevated life satisfaction, subjective vitality, satisfaction of autonomy, relatedness, and competence needs, and a pleasurable, engaging, and meaningful existence. Results have implications for understanding the structure and variability of benefits linked with particular strengths. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Background: Depressive disorder is the biggest risk factor of teenage suicides. To explore the important significance of adolescent depression symptoms' influence factors on family and society. Objective: To investigate the influence of character strengths on adolescent depressive symptoms and the regulating effects of parents' education level on this influence. Its aim to provide a new thinking method for those adolescent mental health workers and Chinese parents on how to provide teenagers with good growing and educational environment and how to effectively reduce the harms brought by depressive disorder. Methods: From April to July 2011, based on the zoning method of Eastern region, Central region and Western region by National Bureau of Statistics in 2003, ten sample provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities were selected through stratified sampling with unequal probabilities, six were from Eastern region (Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian) and four from Central and West regions (Chongqing, Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Anhui); and Shijiazhuang was also included (volunteered to be the sample city). Then 91 sample counties were chosen from these ten sample regions by using systematic sampling method, and 70 628 primary and secondary school students were extracted in a ratio of one over thousand. 47 872 questionnaires were considered as valid samples after investigation and verification. The investigation methods involved network test and paper test. Contents of the questionnaire included depressive symptoms〔Evaluated by Center Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CES-D)〕, character strengths〔Evaluated by Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth (VIA-Youth)〕, and parents' educational level (including levels of primary school, junior high school, senior high school and technical secondary school, college, bachelor degree and above). Results: The character strengths scores of, adolescents whose parents' educational level were junior high school, senior high school and technical secondary school, college degree, bachelor degree or above were higher than those whose parents' educational level was primary school, and their depressive symptoms scores were lower than those whose father's educational level was primary school (P<0.05); the character strengths scores of adolescents whose parents' educational level were senior high school and technical secondary school, college degree, bachelor degree or above were higher than those whose parents' educational level was junior high school, and depressive symptoms scores were lower than those whose parents' educational level was junior high school (P<0.05); the character strengths scores of adolescents whose parents' educational level were college degree, bachelor degree or above were higher than those whose parents' educational level were senior high school and technical secondary school, and depressive symptoms scores of adolescents whose fathers' education level were college degree, bachelor degree or above, mathers' education level was bachelor degree or above were lower than whose parents' educational level was senior high school and technical secondary school (P<0.05); the character strengths scores of adolescents whose parents' educational level was bachelor degree or above were higher than those whose parents' educational level was college degree, and their depressive symptoms scores were lower than those whose parents' educational level was college degree (P<0.05). The partial η2 of effects of father's educational level on character strengths and depressive symptoms scores were 0.034 and 0.010 respectively, while the scores of effects of mother's educational level on character strengths and depressive symptoms scores were 0.035 and 0.010 separately. The interaction of age, character strengths, father's educational level being bachelor degree or above and character strengths, and the interaction between mother's education level being college degree, bachelor degree or above and character strengths had effects on adolescent depressive symptoms (P<0.05). Conclusion: Character strengths can reduce adolescent depressive symptoms and its effect is more obvious in teenagers whose parents possess rather high educational levels. Therefore, training high-quality parents can be a way of preventing and reducing the occurrence of adolescent depression. Copyright © 2016 by the Chinese General Practice.},

  abstract={Objective: This study aims to explore the relationship between virtues and self-disclosure via a cross-sectional study and an intervention study among Chinese.; Methods: In study one, 144 healthy individuals completed the Chinese Virtues Questionnaire (CVQ) and the short version of Jourard Self-Disclosure Questionnaire. In study two, 41 undergraduates voluntarily attended a nine-week intervention. Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) was adopted as the well-being indicator. They were asked to complete the vitality sub-scale of CVQ and SWLS at week one for obtaining the virtue scores and baseline scores of well-being. After an eight-week intervention, SWLS was completed again to examine the intervention efficacy.; Results: Among the three virtues, only vitality had the significant and positive relation with self-disclosure. After eight weeks, the high-vitality group obtained the significant growth of satisfaction with life. The change degree of satisfaction among high vitality individuals was significantly higher than the low vitality group.; Conclusion: Prescreening of individual vitality may be helpful for identifying the sensitive targets of expressive writing intervention. However, considering that this is a preliminary study, more rigorous randomized controlled trials will be helpful to test this conclusion in future. © 2014 Shadowfax Publishing and Informa UK Limited.},

  abstract={Happiness, good mental health and the possession of character strengths have been proposed in the context of positive psychology as important conditions for achieving a life full of gratification. However, there is a scarcity of studies examining those conditions in Eastern cultural contexts, in order to replicate findings from the Western countries. In this vein, the present study aims to explore the influence of strengths on happiness and mental health in the multicultural context of United Arab Emirates and it is hypothesised that certain strengths are better predictors of happiness and mental health than others, also after controlling for potential sociodemographic confounders. A sample of young university students, in the majority coming from eastern countries was assessed through the Global Happiness Scale, the GHQ-12 and the VIA-IS-120. The results of the regression analyses revealed that the group of character strengths under the denomination of Transcendence together with being young was associated with higher levels of happiness and better mental health. In addition, the possession of strengths of Restraint was associated with less happiness, whilst being a man indicated a better mental health. Such results have important implications regarding the replication of previous results from Western contexts in the context of UAE, highlighting the need for implementation of culturally context-tailored strategies for achieving happiness and mental health through the use of character strengths. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Participants were 517 adults who completed self-report measures of SWB, PERMA, and VIA character strengths. Results from four analytic techniques suggest the factor underlying PERMA is capturing the same type of well-being as SWB. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded a latent correlation of r = 0.98 between SWB and PERMA. Exploratory structural equation modeling found two highly related factors (r = 0.85) that did not map onto PERMA and SWB. SWB and PERMA factors showed similar relationships with 24 character strengths (average correlation difference = 0.02). Latent profile analyses yielded subgroups of people who merely scored high, low, or mid-range on well-being indicators. Our findings suggest that while lower-order indicators SWB and PERMA have unique features, they converge onto a single well-being factor. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={In positive psychology, humor has been identified as one of 24 character strengths considered ubiquitously important for human flourishing. Unlike the other strengths, humor was a late addition to this classification system and its status as a strength continues to be somewhat controversial. Therefore, the first purpose of this study was to explore the associations between humor and several outcome variables of relevance to positive psychology (happiness, routes to happiness, resilience, and morality). The second purpose was to explore how best to conceptualize and measure humor as a character strength by comparing the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) Humor Scale with the Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) in their ability to predict the outcome variables. A sample of 176 participants completed questionnaires assessing the humor and positive psychology constructs. The results indicated that the humor measures significantly predicted most of the outcome variables, supporting the importance of humor in positive psychology. Furthermore, although the VIA-IS Humor scale and positive humor styles on the HSQ showed considerable overlap, the negative humor styles added significantly to the prediction of outcome variables beyond these positive humor measures, supporting the importance of assessing maladaptive as well as adaptive uses of humor in research on positive psychology. These findings suggest that the HSQ may be a more useful measure than the VIA-IS Humor scale in future research in this field.},

  abstract={There are few studies examining the relationship between psychopathology and positive experiences and traits. Although initial studies suggest persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at increased risk for excessive social anxiety, there have been no studies to date evaluating how these conditions might interact to affect positive experiences and traits. Using self-report scales, informant ratings, and experience-sampling methodologies, we examined the association of social anxiety with well-being and character strengths in veterans with and without PTSD. Controlling for PTSD and trait negative affect, social anxiety was negatively related to global ratings of well-being and character strengths. Social anxiety also accounted for incremental variance in day-to-day well-being (i.e., daily affect balance, percentage of pleasant days, positive social activity, self-esteem, gratitude) over a 14-day assessment period. Although veterans with PTSD reported lower levels of global and daily well-being and character strengths than veterans without PTSD, a diagnosis of PTSD failed to exhibit unique relationships with these constructs. Building on a growing body of work, these data suggest that social anxiety is uniquely associated with disturbances in positive experiences, events, and traits. Our findings support the value of directly addressing social anxiety in the study and treatment of PTSD. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Previous studies in positive psychology have indicated that work satisfaction is an important determinant of individual well-being. Research has suggested that people are most satisfied with their work when they are doing what they are drawn to naturally. We provide further evidence on this issue from a large representative data set, the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The 2005 wave of the SOEP contains a battery of personality questions as well as detailed information on personal life and work life. We extract the Big Five personality factors and one character strength: vitality. The main results are based on regression analysis. The analysis supports the hypothesis that certain personality clusters are more predominant in some occupations than in others. Furthermore, an alignment between personal profile and occupational profile tends to be related positively to satisfaction. These results indicate that ignoring mental aspects of work has its price in terms of well-being. They also highlight the importance of studying the way we structure work and harness personality and individual strengths within positive psychology. To find out what one is fitted to do and to secure an opportunity to do it is the key to happiness.

  abstract={This study examines whether character strengths predict resilience (operationalized as stable or higher mental health and subjective well-being despite an adverse event) over a period of approximately 1 month during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Spain. Using a longitudinal design, participants (N = 348 adults) completed online measures of sociodemographic data, information regarding their situation in relation to the COVID-19, character strengths, general mental health, life satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect. All variables were measured at Time 1 and Time 2, except for sociodemographic and most COVID-related information (Time 1 only). Time 1 data collection was conducted between March 21, 2020 and April 2, 2020, i.e., approximately the second week of lockdown in Spain. Time 2 data collection was conducted between April 24, 2020 and May 18, 2020, after the Spanish government announced its intention to progressively release the lockdown. A principal component analysis of character strengths was conducted. Five character strength factors were extracted: fortitude, goodness, intellectual, interpersonal, and restraint. Factor structures at Times 1 and 2 were highly consistent. All character strength factors at Time 1 correlated positively with life satisfaction and positive affect, and negatively with negative affect and mental health at T2 (higher scores in the mental health measure indicate poorer mental health). Fortitude strengths showed the highest correlations. We conducted a series of regression analyses with strength factors at Time 1 as predictors, and mental health, life satisfaction, and positive and negative affect as dependent variables, controlling for their baseline levels. To test the directionality of the relationship between strengths and the dependent variables, all analyses were reversed. All character strength factors predicted an increase in mental health. They also predicted positive affect, with the exception of strengths of restraint. Fortitude, intellectual, and interpersonal strengths predicted an increase in life satisfaction. Finally, fortitude strengths, interpersonal strengths, and strengths of restraint, predicted a decrease in negative affect. None of the reversed analyses yielded significant effects. Limitations, implications, and possible character strengths-based interventions aimed at promoting mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.},

Additionally, it was explored if Emotional Intelligence predicted the virtue's levels of the participants, and if Positive Affect constituted a possible mediator. To that end, different measures were used: 419 undergraduate students completed the Spanish version of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale for emotional intelligence (TMMS, Fernandez-Berrocal, Extremera & Ramos, 2004). Character strenghts and virtues were assessed with the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS; Peterson, Park, & Seligman, 2005), and Positive Affect (PA) was measured with the Spanish version of the Positive and Negative Affect (NA) Schedule (PANAS; Sandin et al., 1999). Our results showed a significant positive correlation between all the VIA strengths and virtues with TMMS scales Emotional Clarity and Emotion Repair. Emotional Attention showed significant correlations for all the virtues except Temperance. Further analyses demonstrated that TMMS scales predicted VIA virtues, and Positive Affect appeared as a possible mediator in the prediction of Temperance and Humanity virtues. These results support the relationship between Emotional Intelligence and strength of character, as well as the importance of Positive Affect in this relationship.},

  abstract={The present study was designed to examine the relationships between students' character strengths, school-related affect, positive school functioning (i.e., motivation to learn, interest, and engagement at class), and school achievement following the "engine model of well-being" that is focusing on inputs (e.g., personality traits), processes (e.g., moods, emotions), and outcomes (e.g., engagement, accomplishments) within the context of well-being research. A sample of 196 children completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth, which assesses 24 character strengths, and the PANAS-C that assesses school-related positive and negative affect. Additionally, homeroom teachers rated students' positive school functioning (i.e., motivation, engagement, and interest at school) and their overall school achievement. The character strengths of zest, love of learning, perseverance, and social intelligence showed the strongest positive correlations with school-related positive affect. Teamwork, hope, self-regulation, and love were substantially negatively correlated with school-related negative affect. Certain character strengths showed positive relationships with positive school functioning and overall school achievement. A path model, testing the "engine model of well-being", found-additionally to direct effects-indirect relationships between character strengths and positive school functioning (through school-related positive affect), which in turn leads to higher school achievement. The presented findings show character strengths as meaningful resources in the schooling context. Character strengths emerge to be crucial for students to experience school-related positive affect, which in turn supports students' positive school functioning and their overall school achievement. The results demonstrate the complex interplay between students' personality traits, affect, school functioning, and achievement at school.},

  abstract={Character strengths are positive, morally valued traits of personality. This study aims at assessing the relationship between character strengths and subjective well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, positive and negative affect) in a representative sample of German-speaking adults living in Switzerland (N = 945). We further test whether this relationship is consistent at different stages in life. Results showed that hope, zest, love, social intelligence and perseverance yielded the highest positive correlations with life satisfaction. Hope, zest, humor, gratitude and love presented the highest positive correlations with positive affect. Hope, humor, zest, honesty, and open-mindedness had the highest negative correlations with negative affect. When examining the relationship between strengths and well-being across age groups, in general, hope, zest and humor consistently yielded the highest correlations with well-being. Additionally, in the 27-36 years group, strengths that promote commitment and affiliation (i.e., kindness and honesty) were among the first five positions in the ranking of the relationship between strengths and well-being. In the 37-46 years group, in addition to hope, zest and humor, strengths that promote the maintenance of areas such as family and work (i.e., love, leadership) were among the first five positions in the ranking. Finally, in the 47-57 years group, in addition to hope, zest and humor, strengths that facilitate integration and a vital involvement with the environment (i.e., gratitude, love of learning) were among the first five positions in the ranking. This study partially supports previous findings with less representative samples on the association between character strengths and well-being, and sheds light on the relative importance of some strengths over others for well-being across the life span.},

  abstract={We investigated relationships among five higher-order strengths factors, subjective well-being, and general self-efficacy in participants that live under challenging conditions. Therefore, a sample of 396 Israeli adolescents (aged 13-18 years) completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the Affect Balance Scale, and the General Self-Efficacy Scale. An orthogonally rotated principal component analysis of the 24 character strengths yielded five strengths factors that explained 32% of the variance in life satisfaction, with the transcendence strengths factor as the most substantial predictor. The strongest predictors of positive affect were the transcendence and leadership strengths factors; the best predictors of negative affect were the transcendence and temperance strengths factors; and the strongest predictor of affect balance was the transcendence strengths factor. The five strengths factors explained 46% of the variance in general self-efficacy, with the leadership strengths factor as the most substantial predictor. Further analysis indicated that general self-efficacy mediated the relationship between leadership strengths and global life satisfaction. The results suggest that different strengths factors are relevant for different positive experiences (e.g., life satisfaction, self-efficacy beliefs). The findings shed light on the contribution of specific character strengths as a meaningful resource under stressful conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Method: This short form was developed using data from 2,143 Spanish-speaking adults. The Spanish VIA-120 was developed by selecting the five items with the highest corrected item-total correlations from the 10 items per subscale of the Spanish VIA-IS. Results: Results lent support to the reliability and validity of this short form to measure the 24 character strengths included in The Values in Action (VIA) classification. The internal consistency coefficients of the subscales of the Spanish version of the VIA-120 were substantially equivalent to the long version. The VIA-120 showed high convergence with the Spanish VIA-IS in terms of descriptive statistics and associations with life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect. Factor structure congruence coefficients also indicated very high convergence between the VIA-IS and the short form. Conclusions: The Spanish VIA-120 proved to be a reliable, valid instrument for the assessment of character strengths.},

  abstract={Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) has been established as a key measure for assessment of character strengths and virtues. However its use in multiple measure studies is problematic due to its length. The present study developed a short form of the VIA, VIA-72-Urdu, in Pakistani context and conducted its first validation. Items in short form were retained on the basis of high factor loadings to respective strengths and finalized after verification of cultural validity. The new measure VIA-72-Urdu yielded acceptable reliabilities for research purpose (r values ranging from .64 to .78). Strengths correlated positively with positive affect (median r = .22) and life satisfaction (median r = .20) and negatively with negative affect (median r = -.19). Four factors were derived after exploratory factor analysis and factor structure invariance with long form was determined through multi group confirmatory factor analysis. All virtue factors were positively related with extraversion, conscientiousness and openness to experience and negatively related with neuroticism. Agreeableness was only negatively related with virtue factor of cognitive strengths (median absolute r between virtues and big five traits = .37). The new measure, VIA-72-Urdu provides basis for validation of the same in other languages. The VIA-72 will facilitate future research and assessment on character strengths and virtues.},

Results: Performance was positively related to having opportunities to develop, the character strengths clusters of Wisdom and Knowledge (e.g., curiosity for learning, perspective) and Temperance (e.g., having self-control, beingprudent, humble, andmodest), and exercise frequency. Performance was negatively related to the sense of autonomy and responsibility, contentedness, the character strengths clusters of Humanity and Love (e. g., helping others, cooperation) and Justice (e g., affiliation, fairness, leadership), positive affect, life satisfaction and exercise Intensity.        Conclusion: Call centers may need to create opportunities to develop to increase agents performance an dfocus on individual differences in the recruitment and selection of agents to prevent future shortcomings or worker dissatisfaction. Nevertheless, performance measurement in call centers may need to include other aspects that are more attuned with different character strengths. After all, allowing individuals to put their strengths at work should empower the individual and at the end the organization itself.

However, its effects on strength of character, emotional balance and emotional intelligence are unknown. Materials and methods: in this paper it was shows the effects of this PEI on positive education in a group of 18 students through three questionnaires: VIA-240, PANAS-20 and PIEMO. To estimate the effects of the PEI, a comparison was made between the scores obtained on the three questionnaires before and after the PEI sessions. Results: the results show that not only did character strengths, positive affect and emotional intelligence improve with PEI, but that also the character strengths and the emotional bearings arranged in a network topography changed with intervention. Also, there were some changes in the most connected nodes of the network. Conclusions: these results show that PEI improved the previous reported variables, they also show the way in which the balance of the positive and negative affects, the development of emotional intelligence and the enhancement of character strengths give access to the three pillars of positive psychology.},

Design: Prospective study with consecutive enrollment.        Setting: A Midwestern rehabilitation hospital.        Participants: Persons with mild complicated to severe TBI (N= 65).        Interventions: Not applicable.        Main Outcome Measures: Community Integration Measure, Disability Rating Scale, Modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Values in Action Inventory of Strengths, and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading.        Results: Character virtues and strengths were moderately associated with subjective outcomes, such that there were fewer and less strong associations between character virtues/strengths and objective outcomes than subjective outcomes. Specifically, positive attributes were associated with greater life satisfaction and perceived community integration. Fewer and less strong associations were observed for objective well-being; however, character strengths and virtues showed unique value in predicting physical health and disability. Positive affectivity was not meaningfully related to objective outcomes, but it was significantly related to subjective outcomes. In contrast, negative affectivity was related to objective but not subjective outcomes.        Conclusions: Given the strength of the associations between positive aspects of character or ways of perceiving the world and positive feelings about one's current life situation, treatments focused on facilitating these virtues and strengths in persons who have experienced TBI may result in better perceived outcomes and potentially subsequently lower comorbidities.

A total of 87 Norwegian naval cadets filled out a general survey and then completed a diary questionnaire for 30 consecutive days (total N = 2610). Results of multilevel modelling showed that daily strengths use was positively related to daily positive affect and work engagement, after controlling for previous levels of the dependent variables.

These findings contribute to character strengths and personality theories by showing how blends of personality traits modify the effects of daily strengths use behaviours.

Students' school adjustment was measured through grade point average and questionnaires given to the students' teachers. Findings provided extensive support for the associations among character strengths, subjective well-being (SWB), and middle school adjustment. Intellectual and temperance strengths were central in the prediction of students' school performance and achievements. Interpersonal strengths were significantly related to social functioning at school. Temperance and transcendence strengths were robust positive predictors of students' SWB. The findings extend existing knowledge about character and its relation to optimal functioning and well-being among young adolescents, and have important practical implications for applying strengths-building practices at middle schools.},

  abstract={Theoretical perspectives in positive psychology have considered the possession and use of strengths equally but in applied research more studies focused on having them, probably due to the absence of psychometrically adequate scales. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the psychometric characteristics of the German language version of the Strengths Use Scale (SUS) and to explore relationships between strengths use and several indicator measures of well-being: the presence of positive and the absence of negative affect, self-esteem as identity aspect, vitality as self-regulatory resource, and stress for capturing the evaluation of difficulties and obstacles impinging on well-being. The original English version of the SUS was translated following recommended independent forward-backward translation techniques. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted, including a German-speaking convenience sample of university students (N = 374). Additionally, the relations of strengths use and well-being indicators were analyzed. Factorial validity revealed a single-factor structure of the German version of the SUS, explaining 58.4% variance (factor loadings: 0.58 to 0.86), approving the scale's design and showing high internal consistency (Cronbach's a 0.95). The hypothesized positive relationships of strengths use with positive affect, self-esteem, and vitality were confirmed as well as the negative relationships with negative affect and stress. The German version of the SUS is psychometrically sound and data indicate that individual strengths use and well-being related measures interact. The instrument can be recommended for future research questions such as if and how the promotion of applying individual strengths during education enhances levels of well-being, or how the implementation of strengths use in job-design guidelines or working conditions can result in higher levels of well-being or healthiness.},

In multiple regression, strengths usually related more to positive well-being-life satisfaction, positive affect, vitality, meaning, elevating experience-though vulnerabilities also related to the first three variables; vulnerabilities related more to illbeing-negative affect, depression-though hope, humor, enthusiasm, and forgiveness sometimes also showed relationships. Pre-treatment strengths (hope, spirituality, appreciation of beauty and excellence) predicted post-treatment recovery from depression; cognitive vulnerabilities did not. Strengths and vulnerabilities sometimes interacted, with strengths weakening the relationship between vulnerabilities and well-being. Our findings indicate that strengths and vulnerabilities are not mere opposites (correlating at most moderately) and deserve study as distinct contributors to well-being.},

The most frequently endorsed signature strengths (i.e., five top-ranked strengths within an individual's strength ranking) were emotional (humour, love) and interpersonal strengths (kindness, fairness) in the control group, the most frequently endorsed signature strengths in the ASD group were intellectual strengths (open-mindedness, creativity, love of learning). Interpersonal and emotional strengths had, however, the highest positive associations with SWL in the ASD group.},

  abstract={Jack of all trades, master of none seems apropos to character strengths. Research indicates that readily endorsed and intrinsically motivating strengths (i.e. signature strengths) are most useful in promoting well-being; improving less-developed strengths receives less emphasis. Unfortunately, that research focuses exclusively on explicit self-report. We tested whether strength balance (i.e. jack of all strengths) impacts well-being beyond mastering signature strengths by conducting a multivariate regression with signature strengths and strength balance predicting life satisfaction and psychological need (relatedness, competency, and autonomy) satisfaction. We also developed a novel, strength-based implicit association test (IAT) to complement explicit measurement. Our study (N = 140 adults) results suggest that signature strengths and strength balance uniquely predicted greater well-being. Though our IAT possessed poor internal consistency, it provides valuable information regarding the design of future implicit measures of character strengths. Strength balance and implicit strength measurement may offer new opportunities to further understanding of personality and well-being.},

In this research, the effectiveness of an MBI was evaluated on variables that can promote successful job performance such as mindfulness trait, positive and negative affect, forgiveness, personality strengths and satisfaction with life. The intervention was carried out through a smartphone application called "Aire Fresco" (Fresh Air) during 14 days in the middle of the quarantine produced by the Covid-19 pandemic. The study sample was composed of 164 Spanish people who were distributed in two groups: control group and experimental group, which were evaluated before and after the intervention. The MANCOVA performed showed an overall positive effect of the intervention on the variables evaluated. The different ANCOVAs carried out showed that the intervention was beneficial in increasing mindfulness trait, reducing negative affect or increasing life satisfaction, among others.

Objectives: The present study aimed to explore the role of character strengths, emotions, and resilience in predicting job stress in a sample of Iranian military personnel.        Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited a total number of 146 military personnel via convenience sampling and administered the Health and Safety Executive Stress Questionnaire, Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale, Values in Action Inventory of Strengths, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The correlation analysis and stepwise linear regression were performed using SPSS22.        Results: Job stress was negatively associated with resilience, positive emotions, and character strengths and positively associated with negative emotions (P < 0.001). Regression analysis revealed that three variables, including resilience, courage, and negative emotions could predict 57% of the variance in job stress (Adj. R-2 = 0.57, P < 0.001).        Conclusions: Higher resilience and courage are associated with lower job stress. Also, negative emotions such as anger, guilt, and anxiety would contribute to higher job stress. Providing training courses to develop and boost resilience and courage and manage negative emotions can offset the negative effects of job stress on military personnel. Also, considering these factors as recruitment criteria would lead to the enlistment of cadets who may be more resilient to stress.},

This study aimed to investigate the role of strength-based parenting moderators in the relationship between character strength and psychological well-being. Methods: The research design was correlational. The statistical population included all sixth-grade students in the 18th district of Tehran in 2019-2020, which comprised 300 sixth-grade students who were selected through a stratified cluster random sampling method. Students completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS), Ryff's scale of Psychological well-being, short-form (18item), Strengths Use Questionnaire, and Parent-Child Relationship Questionnaire (PCRS). Descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, and hierarchical regression were performed through SPSS statistical software, version 25. Results: The demographic characteristics of the sample showed that 54% of the sample were firstborn, 35% were second-born and 9.7% were third-born. The findings revealed that there is a positive and significant relationship between character strength and psychological well-being (P < 0.01). The results also illuminated that strength-based parenting has a moderating effect on the relationship between character strength and psychological well-being in children (P < 0.01). In total, 55% of changes in psychological well-being were explained by the strength of character and strengthbased parenting. Conclusion: According to the research findings, it can be concluded that strength-based parenting will change the strength of character and psychological well-being of students.},

A total of 225 undergraduates completed paper-and-pencil questionnaires assessing character strengths, strengths use, future self-continuity, and subjective well-being. Results suggested several character strengths were correlated with subjective well-being and the strongest correlations were found for hope, curiosity, zest, perseverance and love. All character strengths were significantly correlated with strengths use. Strengths use and future self-continuity were robustly correlated with subjective well-being. The mediation analysis showed that strengths use mediates the relationship between character strengths and subjective well-being, and specifically, the indirect effects of strengths use varies from different character strengths. The moderated mediator suggested that future self-continuity moderated the mediation of strengths use because future self-continuity moderates the effect of strengths use on subjective well-being. Furthermore, the indirect effect of strengths use was stronger with high level of future self-continuity than those with low level of future self-continuity. The present findings make a contribution to understand the underlying mechanisms involving in character strengths are associated with higher level of well-being. Additionally, the findings expand knowledge about future self-continuity and its relation to strengths use and subjective well-being among undergraduates, having significant implications in the educational context.},

We expected positive direct links between the constructs and indirect effects through emotional exhaustion. To test these hypotheses, 387 medical students in their first year and 136 resident physicians completed five scales measuring well-being, mental/physical health, character strengths, the application of their five individual signature strengths, and emotional exhaustion as an indicator of burnout. Partial correlations were examined, and mediation analyses performed. ASCS at work was positively linked with well-being and mental health but not with physical health. All links were mediated by emotional exhaustion in Study 1 and (except for mental health) also in Study 2. Future studies would therefore do well to investigate the promotion of ASCS at work of people operating in medical education and its potential in fostering well-being and preventing burnout from the outset.},

The present study examined the comparability of the two questionnaires most frequently used in research: The VIA Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) for adults and the VIA Inventory of Strengths for Youth (VIA-Youth). A sample of N = 170 high-school students in the age of about 18 years and up to two informants (N = 164 mostly parents; N = 156 mostly friends and partners) completed both character strengths questionnaires and several well-being questionnaires. The psychometric characteristics and the correlations with well-being scales were examined once exclusively on the basis of self-rating and once on the basis of combined self- and informant-ratings. Substantial differences between the questionnaires were found in each of the criteria examined (e.g., identification of signature strengths, or largest associations with well-being). The results indicate that VIA-IS and VIA-Youth measure character strengths differently, so that a comparison across age groups may lead to biased conclusions. Therefore, differences in character strengths between adults and adolescents should not be exclusively interpreted in terms of differences on the trait level as these differences may be caused by nonequivalent questionnaires.},

  abstract={Character strengths have been found to consistently predict many positive psychological outcomes, such as well-being, life satisfaction, and mental health, but research on the topic is still at its infancy and some methodological limitations must be overcome to better understand what character strengths are and what is their role. One main issue concerns the structure of character strengths and virtues, which may undermine the credibility and replicability of previous findings. Using two different samples (with 13,439 and 944 participants), we confirm that character strengths can be well described by a bifactor model reflecting the simultaneous existence of a general factor of 'good character' and the 24 specific character strengths. We found that the general factor consistently predicts participants' life satisfaction, mental health, and distress symptoms. In addition, we show that the specific character strengths (with the few exceptions represented by gratitude, hope, and zest) do not predict life satisfaction and mental health above and beyond the general factor. These results highlight the need to better understand what this general factor really represents to finally capture the mechanisms linking character strengths between each other and with external outcomes. Implications for the measurement and interpretation of character strengths and for strength-based interventions are discussed.},

Longitudinal data from the Growing Up Today Study were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Sample sizes ranged from 5,681 to 7,458, depending on outcome; the mean baseline age was 14.74 years, and there were 8-14 years of follow-up (1999 to either 2007, 2010, or 2013). Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing. All models were controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, maternal health, and prior values of the outcome variables whenever data were available. Compared with no attendance, at least weekly attendance of religious services was associated with greater life satisfaction and positive affect, a number of character strengths, lower probabilities of marijuana use and early sexual initiation, and fewer lifetime sexual partners. Analyses of prayer or meditation yielded similar results. Although decisions about religion are not shaped principally by health, encouraging service attendance and private practices in adolescents who already hold religious beliefs may be meaningful avenues of development and support, possibly leading to better health and well-being.},

  abstract={A growing body of research demonstrates the relevance of character strengths for flourishing in general, but also for important outcomes across different life domains (e.g., work performance and relationship satisfaction). Studies have also shown that there are differences in the extent to which character strengths are applied, that is, perceived as relevant and shown in behavior in a given context, between work and private life, but they have not considered other life domains. This study aims to close this gap by examining the life domains of work, education, leisure, close personal relationships, and romantic relationships. The present study investigates whether (a) strengths-related behavior across different life domains explains additional variance in flourishing beyond the trait level of each respective character strength and studies (b) differences in the relevance of character strengths and strengths-related behavior across different life domains, and examines (c) their relationships with flourishing. A sample of 203 German-speaking adults (78.8% females; mean age = 29.4 years) completed self-reports assessing flourishing and character strengths. They also indicated which of the five life domains were personally relevant to them (i.e., on average 4.23 life domains) and reported the character strengths' perceived relevance and the frequency of displaying strengths-related behavior for each of these life domains separately. The results demonstrate that (a) strengths-related behavior averaged across all relevant life domains explained unique variance in flourishing above the trait-level of character strengths in some cases (e.g., creativity, kindness, and fairness), (b) different life domains were characterized by specific profiles of character strength-regarding both their relevance and strength-related behavior. Moreover, (c) character strengths and strengths-related behavior in different life domains both showed substantial correlations with flourishing. In some cases, these associations were domain-specific (e.g., displaying love of learning in the context of education was related to higher levels of flourishing). In conclusion, we suggest that examining strengths-related behavior across different life domains represents a worthwhile addition to research on character strengths.},

  abstract={Background: Nurses displayed low levels of subjective well-being and high turnover intention. How to enhance the subjective well-being and decrease the turnover rate of nurses is of great importance. However, little is known about whether work engage-ment mediates between character strengths and subjective well-being. The study aims to explore character strengths, work engage-ment and subjective well-being in nurses, and to determine whether work engagement plays a mediating role between the rela-tionship. Material and Methods: From December 2017 to December 2018, 450 Chinese registered nurses completed the character strengths scale, work engagement scale, and subjective well-being scale. The relationship between study variables was tested by Pearson correlation. The mediating effect of work engagement was tested by the bootstrap method. Results: The results indicated the following: (1) the 4 elements of character strengths and work engagement were significantly and positively correlated with subjective well-being; (2) character strengths could significantly predict both work engagement and subjective well-being; (3) work engagement played a mediating role in this relationship. Condusions: Character strengths affect subjective well-being in Chinese registered nurses, and work engagement plays a mediating variable among the relations. Therefore, nurses are encouraged to foster their character strengths and improve their level of work engagement for their subjective well-being. Following the results, the study recommends that nursing managers be aware of the importance of using character strengths in nursing work, taking actions to excavate nurses' character strengths and encouraging nurses to use character strengths in clinical work to promote engagement and well-being. In the meantime, interventions to improve the level of subjective well-being based on nurses' character strengths should be considered. Med Pr. 2022;73(4)},

  abstract={The network approach poses an alternative focus to understand psychological constructs as emerging from mutual interactions among indicators. Network psychometrics has been applied to psychopathology to unravel the connections between symptoms, but it can also be applied to the study of well-being. The role of character strengths in mental health is at the forefront of research attention. Previous findings suggest that heart character strengths are more predictive of mental health than mind character strengths. Nevertheless, researchers have rarely applied the network approach in this context. The present study examines, from the network approach, the connections between heart and mind character strengths and mental health. Building upon the dual-factor model of mental health, positive (i.e., happiness and life satisfaction) and negative indicators (i.e., depression) were included in the assessment of this construct. A sample of 597 Spanish undergraduates (M = 23.52; SD = 5.25; 75.6% females) completed cross-sectional self-report measures. Network analysis was used to estimate a network composed of two communities: character strengths and mental health. We used centrality analysis to calculate the importance of each node and bridge centrality to examine the interactions between the communities. The results indicated that the heart strengths of love, zest, hope, and gratitude reported the highest bridge strength centrality, suggesting that they played an intermediary role activating and deactivating components of mental health. Adopting the network approach to explore the connections between character strengths and mental health can help design focused intervention strategies in psychology.},

  abstract={Individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities, in response to stress associated with COVID-19, may experience a decrease in their overall well-being beyond that experienced by otherwise healthy individuals. Therefore, it is imperative to identify internal resources (e.g., character strengths) that can help them better manage COVID-19-related stress and enhance well-being in spite of COVID-19. This study explored the potential protective role of character strengths and virtues in moderating the negative effects of COVID-19 on stress and well-being. A cross-sectional study design was implemented. Participants included 269 individuals with self-reported chronic conditions and disabilities. After controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics, we examined whether character strengths and virtues acted as independent moderators between COVID-19-related stress and well-being. A higher degree of multiple character strengths significantly and independently moderated the relationship between COVID-19-related stress and well-being. Findings suggested the importance of promoting more character strengths overall in people with chronic conditions and disabilities to help them better manage COVID-19-related stress and enhance well-being.},

In this study, the Character Strengths Rating Form (CSRF), a 24-item rating form of character strengths based on the classification proposed by Peterson and Seligman (2004), was developed using the data of 211 German-speaking adults. The CSRF yielded good convergence with Peterson and Seligman's Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) in terms of descriptive statistics, relationships with socio-demographic variables, and associations with life satisfaction; the means correlated .91, and standard deviations correlated .80. Correlations between corresponding strengths in the CSRF and the VIA-IS were between .41 and .77. Rank-order correlations of the correlations of both measures with age, education, and life satisfaction were .74, .76, and .84, respectively. Factor structure congruence coefficients ranged between .92 and .99. The rank-order correlation of the associations of the 5 factors with life satisfaction was .90. The CSRF proved to be a valid instrument for the assessment of character strengths. Its use is recommended for a brief measurement of character strengths when economy of instruments is at a premium (e.g., in large-scale longitudinal studies). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract={Signature character strengths can foster health-related outcomes in work and private life, thus being particularly important for endangered occupational groups like physicians. However, situational circumstances need to allow character strengths demonstration (applicability) first to enable their application. Therefore, this study addresses the role of (1) applicability of signature character strengths in work and private life beyond their possession and (2) relationships with well-being, work engagement, and burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment). Hospital physicians (N = 274) completed an online survey examining their signature character strengths and applicability, well-being, work engagement, and burnout dimensions. The top-five individual signature character strengths were fairness, honesty, judgment, kindness, and love. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions revealed that the possession as well as the applicability of signature character strengths was important in work and private life, but to different degrees. Possessing fairness, honesty, or kindness indicated significant positive relations with subjective well-being, whereas judgment and kindness seemed to negatively interact with reduced personal accomplishment. Hospital physicians' applicability of fairness, honesty, judgment, and love was particularly essential for their psychological well-being and work engagement, whereas the applicability of fairness (reduced personal accomplishment) and judgment (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization) at work interacted negatively with the respective outcomes. Therefore, creating awareness for individual signature character strengths as well as providing applicability in hospitals and private life could be a promising approach to improve physicians' well-being and consequently patient care as well as the performance of the health-care system in general.},

We were interested in studying several transitions that are specific for older people: aging, retirement, living alone, and being widowed. We examined the relationships of these demographic characteristics and living conditions with character strengths and studied their effects on the association of character strengths with life satisfaction. In a cross-sectional analysis, 15,598 older adults (aged 46-93 years) who had completed measures on character strengths, life satisfaction, and demographic characteristics and living conditions were selected from an existing database. Overall, analyses revealed positive associations of most character strengths with age, and higher scores in most character strengths for the employed (vs. the retired) and those living with a partner (vs. those living alone), while only few relationships with being widowed (vs. being married) were observed. Further, the contribution of character strengths to life satisfaction generally decreased slightly with age, but increased for certain character strengths, such as modesty or prudence. Also, stronger relationships between several character strengths and life satisfaction were found for retired people and those living alone, while being widowed did not affect these relationships. The results demonstrate how character strengths might contribute to the life satisfaction of older adults in various living conditions and thereby offer a starting point for strengths-based programs in later life.},

  abstract={Character strengths are positively valued personality traits that are assumed to be stable across time and situations, but also malleable due to cultivation or deliberate intervention. Also, studies showed that character strengths are robustly related to well-being. Consequently, character strengths have often been used in interventions aimed at increasing well-being. However, the stability of character strengths and the longitudinal relationships with well-being are widely unexplored: First, previous reports on the stability of character strengths have mainly focused on one assessment instrument only and second, they did not consider other indicators of stability (and malleability) besides rank-order stability, (i.e., mean-level stability). In this longitudinal study, we assessed character strengths and well-being at two time points and examined the stability and malleability of character strengths and the convergence of changes in character strengths and well-being by means of correlation analyses. Two samples (n(1) = 601, n(2) = 1162) completed different measures of character strengths and instruments for the assessment of well-being, ill-being, and health within up to three and a half years. Results showed that character strengths are stable over longer time periods (test-retest reliabilities ranging from r(tt) = .60-.83) and that relationships between changes in strengths and well-being are highly parallel to what has been reported in cross-sectional studies (strongest relationships for zest, hope, curiosity, and love). Furthermore, results suggest that some strengths, most predominantly humor, but also spirituality and prudence might be more amenable for change than others. These results might bear important information for selecting character strengths in interventions.},

  abstract={Introduction: Extreme disasters have increased exponentially in recent years and result in threats and traumatic reactions in communities globally. Humans turn to their existential relations for survival following disasters; yet, religion and spirituality (R/S) remains underinvestigated in disaster contexts, with most studies measuring general R/S concepts in Christian samples. To address the resulting gap, this study sought to (a) establish short form, disaster-specific scales of perceived spiritual support (PSS); (b) test the factor's relationships with mental health outcomes; and (c) explore moderators of those relationships. Method: With strong community engagement, a culturally diverse sample (N = 566) completed an online survey after Hurricanes Maria and Michael (H-MM). Multivariate analyses established psychometric properties for 2 PSS short-form scales (PSSS-S1 and -S2) and revealed associations between and moderators of (disaster-related experiences and character strengths) the scales and 2 traumatic outcomes: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and posttraumatic growth (PTG). Results: PSSS-S1 and -S2 demonstrated adequate reliability and validity. PSS was associated inversely with PTSD symptoms at a marginal level but positively and strongly with PTG. Character strengths moderated the link of PSS to PTSD but not PTG. Most disaster-related factors were associated with both outcomes. Conclusions: The findings highlight the function of PSS in survival. PSSS-S1 and -S2 are adequate measures for rapid and cross-cultural data collection in extreme disasters. The differential associations of PSS and moderators with the 2 outcomes can be interpreted in light of 2 forms of well-being, which may have implications for theory, research, and practice in trauma psychology.        Clinical Impact Statement This study found that a sense of existential relatedness (i.e., perceived spiritual support or PSS) may be as potent as close human relations for well-being in times of crisis. Two, now-validated short-form versions of a PSS measure are offered for use with disaster survivors. PSS, along with trait hope and optimism, predicted post-traumatic growth among hurricane victims. Trait optimism, gratitude, need for positive affect, and strength of faith buffered against PTSD. Hurricane-related emotional responses and stressors predicted both outcomes. The study shows that faith-related constructs and positive character strengths are important factors for practitioners to explore for a better understanding of collective resilience. At the same time, they should also consider immediate emotional reactions to, stressors caused by, and past trauma reminded by the catastrophe, which may help ease some long-term, trauma-induced symptoms and facilitate growth and well-being in the future.},

  abstract={This study of Spanish early adolescents aimed to extend knowledge about the relationship between character strengths and life satisfaction (LS) and to explore gender differences in the prediction of LS. A sample of 457 adolescents aged 11-14 years completed questionnaires to assess LS and 24 character strengths. Results from simple correlation analysis showed that 18 strengths were positively and significantly correlated with LS, the highest coefficients being those for love, hope, authenticity and persistence. However, since strengths are inter-correlated, regression modelling was performed in order to determine which of these strengths are the best predictors of LS, and to identify any gender differences in this association. The results showed that love and hope were the most relevant strengths for predicting LS, with a positive relationship being observed for both girls and boys. This finding highlights the importance of positive thinking and of maintaining positive relationships during early adolescence. Gender differences were observed, however, for authenticity as a predictor of LS. Specifically, this variable made a significant contribution to the model in girls, for whom higher scores on authenticity were associated with greater LS. This result is interpreted in terms of gender differences in the timing of maturation. The findings help to further our understanding of the association between subjective well-being and character strengths in early adolescence, a critical stage of human development. In addition, the results suggest that intervention programmes based on character strengths in this developmental stage should mainly target the so-called 'strengths of the heart'.},

Objective: To investigate the factor structure of the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA)-72 in a sample of individuals with MS.        Methods: This quantitative descriptive study included 624 individuals with MS. The factor structure of the VIA-72 was examined using principal component analysis. The internal consistency reliability and validity were assessed by computing Cronbach's alphas and correlations of the VIA-72 with other psychosocial constructs, respectively.        Findings: The principal component analysis revealed an interpretable four-factor structure of the VIA-72: intellectual and emotional strengths, temperance, transcendence, and interpersonal strengths. The factors significantly correlated with measures of quality of life, resilience, social support, depression, fatigue, and personality traits, indicating good concurrent validity. The four factors did not completely align with Peterson and Seligman's (2004) classification system.        Conclusions: The four-factor structure of the VIA-72 seems to be interpretable, valid, and reliable. Measures like VIA-72 may help rehabilitation professionals learn more about the nature and development of character strengths among persons with MS and suggest ways to cultivate it. Further studies are indicated to confirm the factor structures and psychometric properties of this scale in persons with MS.},

  abstract={Introduction: Identifying protective factors against internalizing behaviors during adolescence is a public health priority, as rates of depression and anxiety are rising. As such, the purpose of this study was to examine whether prosocial engagement toward strangers and family members is protective against depressive and anxiety symptoms, and whether this link is mediated by character strengths (i.e., hope, persistence, gratitude, and self-esteem).        Method: The sample consisted of 500 US adolescents (52% female; 66% European American; 33% from single-parent families). Data across three consecutive yearly waves were utilized in the current study (M-age Time 1 = 13.32).        Results: Results of a longitudinal structural equation model revealed prosocial behavior toward strangers and family members were differentially related to character strengths, and that prosocial behavior toward strangers was indirectly associated with depressive symptoms via self-esteem.        Conclusion: Taken together, findings extend the Developmental Cascades model and suggest that prosocial behavior and character strengths protect against depressive symptoms during the adolescent period. Findings are discussed in the context of relevant research and theory, and implications for future research and intervention programs are presented.},

Findings revealed a fourth-factor structure of character strengths that included the typical tripartite classification of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and intellectual strengths together with spirituality emerging as a statistically autonomous factor. Spirituality was stable over time and contributed to higher subjective well-being and prosociality both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

The research method was structural equation modelling. The sample consisted of 376 university students between the ages of 20-30 (mean = 24.3) years old selected through cluster random sampling. Fifty-seven percent of the participants were females from the science and research branch at Azad University. The data were collected using the self-compassion scale (SCS) (Neff, 2003a), the values in action inventory of strengths (Peterson and Seligman, 2004) and the human flourishing questionnaire (HFQ) (Soleimani et al., 2015). The data was analysed using path analysis through LISREL software. The character strengths of love, gratitude and hope with the mediating role of self-compassion have an indirect effect on flourishing. According to the results, optimising character strengths (especially emotional strengths) help people to accept themselves without self-judgement and self-criticism, which in turn improves individual flourishing.},

Honesty, humor, and love were the most preferred character strengths in an ideal partner. Hope, religiousness, honesty, and fairness showed the most substantial assortment coefficients. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed targets' character strengths as explaining variance in targets' life satisfaction. Furthermore, to a lesser degree, specific character strengths of partners and couples' similarity in certain character strengths explained variance in targets' life satisfaction beyond targets' character strengths.

However, few studies explored the connection between character strengths and marital satisfaction. The present study, conducted on a sample of 177 married couples, aims to examine this connection. Given the findings of previous studies, showing that both spouses' personality traits contribute to relationship quality, we expect to find a connection between the spouses' strengths and their marital quality. Using actor-partner interdependence model analyses, we examined the effects of three strengths factors (caring, self-control, and inquisitiveness) of both the individual and the partner on marital quality, evaluated by indices measuring marital satisfaction, intimacy, and burnout. Our findings revealed that the individual's three strengths factors were related to all of his or her marital quality indices (actor effects). Moreover, women's caring, inquisitiveness and self-control factors were associated with men's marital quality, and men's inquisitiveness and self-control factors were associated with women's marital quality (partner effects). Our findings join the efforts of previous studies to understand the association between character strengths and the various elements of mental well-being, especially romantic relationships.},

Thirty-three individuals with AS/HFA and 33 gender-, age-and education-matched typically developing (TD) participants filled out scales assessing character strengths (VIA-IS), life satisfaction (SWLS) and orientation to happiness (OTH). Profile analyses of the character strengths and character strengths factors revealed significant differences between the two groups. Humor was found to be the 8th highest out of 24 character strengths in TD, but was only at the 16th position in individuals with AS/HFA when the strengths are rank-ordered. In TD participants, humor is related to life of pleasure, life of engagement, life of meaning and life satisfaction. In individuals with AS/HFA, humor is only related to life of pleasure. This shows that 1) individuals with AS/HFA seem not to consider humor as one of their important strengths, which is in line with humor difficulties reported earlier and 2) humor does not seem to contribute to life satisfaction to the same degree as in TD controls.},

  abstract={Recent literature suggests that people increase their life satisfaction over time as a result of developing positive psychological resources (e.g. benefit finding). However, this hypothesis has not yet tested in children. Since suffering from illness is usually associated with challenge and growth, we hypothesized that changes in life satisfaction in a sample of ill children would depend on to what extent they developed resources. Children with a life threatening illness (N = 67 at T1 and N = 49 at T2, ages 7-18 years) completed the Student Life Satisfaction Scale, a measure of health-related functioning problems, a measure of positive emotions (PE), the Benefit Finding Scale for Children, and a measure of strengths from the Values in Action Inventory of Character Strengths for Youth. The same measures were assessed 6 months after the first assessment. Using structural equation modeling techniques, results revealed that health-related functioning problems were associated with negative changes in life satisfaction over time. Moreover, increases in benefit finding and character strengths (i.e., love and gratitude) predicted positive changes in LS over time. Finally, PE predicted changes in benefit finding over time through several personal strengths (i.e., vitality and gratitude). The development of positive psychological resources in children experiencing high levels of stress may promote desirable psychological outcomes. Therefore, in order to help clinicians prevent negative outcomes, future research should strive to better understand life satisfaction and its underlying predictors in children experiencing difficult life circumstances.},

The 24 scales yielded high reliability and exhibited stability over 4 months. Self-reports and parent-ratings of strengths converged well. An oblique five-factor solution was found to represent the data well. There were small age effects, and small to medium gender effects (e. g., girls scored higher on beauty and kindness). Character strengths of hope, gratitude, love, and zest correlated positively with global life satisfaction. Furthermore, most of the strengths were strong predictors of general self-efficacy. Overall, the German VIA-Youth demonstrated good psychometric properties and promising evidence for validity.

Bootstrap testing approach was implemented to compute direct and indirect effects and total effect in the mediation analysis. Altogether 235 students from two Turkish universities participated in the study. The results showed that character strengths were associated with lower levels of depression and it was negatively associated with perceived stress and negative attributional style. The results also indicated that perceived stress and negative attribution style completely mediated the relationship between character strengths and depression among Turkish college students. These findings suggested the need to develop empirically supported interventions that can promote character strengths toward reducing stress, negative attributions, and depression in this population.},

Using character strengths, which are narrower and designed to describe desirable behavior, could provide new insights.Method: In this study, we examined 204 outstanding individuals-exemplars who received or were nominated for a public award recognizing their exemplary behavior (e.g., a Carnegie Rescuers Award; n = 119), individuals holding a patent (n = 62), and individuals living in a religious order (n = 23). We compared these exemplars to comparison samples matched based on demographic variables. All participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing character strengths and well-being (e.g., satisfaction with life).Results: Results showed that the three groups of exemplars differed meaningfully in their character strengths and well-being from the matched comparison groups. Compared with matched counterparts, moral exemplars scored higher on the strengths related to the virtues of courage, humanity, and justice as well as the character strength of humility, creative exemplars scored higher on the character strengths of creativity and honesty, and religious exemplars scored higher on gratitude and spirituality.Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that character strengths are a useful framework for studying exemplary behavior.},

In addition, no studies to date have examined its Italian version. We validated the structure of the Italian short form of the VIA-IS in a sample of 16722 participants. Using confirmatory factor analysis and treating items as ordinal variables, we followed three simple, but too often neglected, steps: we studied the unidimensionality of the single strengths first, then their convergence into second-order virtues, and then fitted a hierarchical model that includes items, strengths and virtues, as originally proposed by Peterson and Seligman. All strengths except "love of learning" were unidimensional, and both the virtues and the final hierarchical models showed acceptable fit indices, unlike three models derived from an exploratory factor analysis. The same findings emerged for a smaller sample of 1035 participants. Finally, both character strengths and virtues showed positive relations with general mental health and negative relations with psychological distress. These results are discussed considering previous studies on the factorial structure of the VIA-IS.},

However, there is a lack of research on possible antecedents of the applicability of signature character strengths in the occupational domain. In this study we examined whether the perceived socio-moral climate of medical departments has a positive impact on the applicability of hospital physicians' signature character strengths and whether it relates to work engagement, hedonic subjective well-being (SWB) and eudaimonic psychological well-being (PWB). Based on cross-sectional data of N = 165 hospital physicians in Austria, we tested mediation models with perceived socio-moral climate as predictor, applicability of signature character strengths as mediator, and work engagement, SWB and PWB as outcomes. Additionally, we collected longitudinal data (time-lag T1-T2: 6 months) from a subsample (n = 69) for testing the relationship between the perceived socio-moral climate and the applicability of signature character strengths over time. The cross-sectional results showed indirect effects of the perceived socio-moral climate on work engagement and eudaimonic well-being via the applicability of signature character strengths at work. Results from a cross-lagged panel analysis suggested an impact of socio-moral climate at T1 on the applicability of signature character strengths 6 months later (T2), but also an even stronger reversed effect of the applicability of signature character strengths at T1 on perceived socio-moral climate at T2.},

Results confirmed that political violence exposure was positively correlated with psychiatric symptoms. Interpersonal, temperance and transcendence strengths were negatively associated with psychiatric symptoms. Moderating effects of the interpersonal strengths on the relation between political violence exposure and the psychiatric and PTSD indices were confirmed. The findings extend existing knowledge about the resilience function of character strengths in exposure to protracted conflict and have important practical implications for applying strength-building practices for adolescents who grow up in war-affected environments.},

Specific character strengths (e.g., love of learning, zest, hope, perseverance, and perspective) were substantially positively related to school satisfaction, enjoyment of learning, academic self-efficacy, and/or school achievement. Exploratory mediation analyses supported the basic assumption that processes (i.e., school satisfaction, enjoyment of learning, and academic self-efficacy) mediate the relations between character strengths as input variables and school achievement as an outcome variable. The findings underline the benefit of studying inputs, processes, and outcomes simultaneously to better understand the interplay among relevant variables in the context of positive schooling.},

  abstract={Background: Adolescents with Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) are at higher risk of academic underachievement, stigmatization, and mental health issues. However, the complete elimination of disorder-related deficits and external challenges is an impracticable solution for enhancing their well-being. Aim: The study adopts a strength-based approach to understand the role of an innate factor, i.e., self-concept, in the association between character strengths and well-being of adolescents with SLD. Methods: A correlational research design following a mediation analysis was adopted to examine the association between the study variables on a sample of 115 adolescents with SLD from India. Results: Self-concept functioned as a partial mediator between the life-satisfaction construct of well-being and six character strengths: Appreciation of beauty and excellence, Perseverance, Judgment, Leadership, Perspective, and Zest. Gender differences were identified with regard to the study variables. Conclusions and implications: Self-concept of adolescents with SLD could partly contribute to enhanced character strengths awareness to protect well-being. Further, the crucial role of internal factors like self-concept and character strengths in improving the well-being of this population was highlighted. Thereby encouraging future research on SLD to adopt approaches that focus on innate strengths rather than deficits and external sources of well-being.},

This study focuses on the protective role of character strengths in sustaining mental health and self-efficacy during lockdown. Data were collected from 944 Italian respondents (mean age = 37.24 years, SD = 14.50) by means of an online survey investigating character strengths, psychological distress and Covid-19-related self-efficacy one month after lockdown began. Using principal component analysis, four strengths factors were extracted, namely transcendence, interpersonal, openness and restraint. Regression models with second-order factors showed that transcendence strengths had a strong inverse association with psychological distress, and a positive association with self-efficacy. Regression models with single strengths identified hope, zest, prudence, love and forgiveness as the strengths most associated with distress, love and zest as the most related to self-efficacy and zest to general mental health. Openness factor and appreciation of beauty showed an unexpected direct relation with psychological distress. These results provide original evidence of the association of character strengths, and transcendence strengths in particular, with mental health and self-efficacy in a pandemic and are discussed within the field of positive psychology.},

This study used a cross-sectional and descriptive study design with 214 fifth- and sixth-grade elementary school children from low-income families enrolled in 20 community centers and receiving government financial assistance. A bivariate probit model was used to examine the association between character strength and mental health problems in the children. We found that character strength lowers the likelihood of developing hyperactivity-inattention and emotional symptoms among children from low-income families. Additionally, adverse life events were associated with increased mental health problems, whereas adverse life events were not significantly correlated with character strength in the current study. Specific interventions should be developed to cultivate character strength among children in early adolescence from low-income families who are at a high risk of mental health problems under cumulative adverse life events.},

This study examines the relationships among these character strengths, including Happiness, Life Purpose and Life Satisfaction as valued by Singapore Chinese, Malays, Indians and Other Asians and Caucasians. A sample of Singapore adults (N = 304) completed an online survey in English comprising four measures, the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths, the Orientations to Happiness Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Life Engagement Test. Results show that Zest, Hope, Curiosity, Capacity to Love and Gratitude are the top five character strengths of the sampled Singaporeans. Happiness orientation through pursuing a Life of Meaning is preferred by all four ethnic groups. Ethnic differences are found for character strengths of Kindness, Humour, Gratitude, and Religiousness and Spirituality. Life of Meaning and Life of Engagement, Happiness orientations and character strengths of Curiosity and Perseverance are direct predictors of Life Purpose. In turn, Life Purpose and character strengths of Capacity to Love and Gratitude are found to be direct predictors of Life Satisfaction. Despite its other limitations, this study lays the groundwork for future studies using more robust sampling strategies and greater participation from the major ethnic groups in Singapore.},

Results: findings showed virtues and CS of wisdom, justice, humanity, and transcendence (except for spirituality) are significantly related to psychological distress. With increasing CS, psychological distress in employees decreased, but with increasing virtues, psychological distress in employees increased. The virtues and CS of temperance and courage were not significantly associated with psychological distress.        Conclusions: According to the results of this study, military services should pay more attention to the virtues and CS effective in reducing staff distress and strengthening these traits in them.},

The problem of character strength research on suicide prevention is that the link between various character strengths and suicide has not been comprehensively examined. We explored which character strength is associated with suicidal ideation. The study is a cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey. Participants were 2,000 Internet users in Japan aged 20 years or older. The online survey covered suicidal ideation, character strengths and demographic details. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed with the suicidal ideation as the dependent variable and character strengths as the independent variable. A significant regression equation was found (F (22, 1977) = 64.65, P < 0.001), with an R-2 of 0.42. 'Engagement' (B = -0.38, P < 0.001), 'Love' (B = -0.33, P = 0.001), and 'Risk-taking' (B = 0.40, P < 0.001) were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. The positive trait of being able to actively engage with people and build a loving relationship could be a protective factor for suicide.},

Further, we examined which (5) attributes of character strengths, such as their association with morality or well-being, predict change goals. Participants (Study 1: N = 2,792 German-speaking adults, 79.2% women, median = 46 years; Study 2: N = 6,787 English-speaking adults, 67.0% women, median = 32 years) completed measures of character strengths, character strengths change goals, and well-being. A subsample (n = 1,739) provided informant ratings. Results showed that participants wanted to increase all 24 character strengths. Most change goals showed negligible associations with participants' well-being and age. Except for spirituality, participants-especially the less happy-wanted to change those character strengths they lacked. The character strengths' relationship with well-being, but not their moral value, predicted the goals to change them.},

Health-behaviors and the mediating role of health-behaviors in explaining the relationship between character and well-being were also considered. Emotional, intellectual strengths and strengths of the heart were positively associated with life satisfaction and physical fitness. Emotional strengths correlated positively with the self-evaluation of feeling healthy. All strengths (except for modesty and religiousness) were related to health-behaviors; e.g. healthy eating and watching ones food consumption were associated with self-regulation and intellectual strengths. Health behaviors partially mediated the relation of broader strengths factors on subjective and physical well-being. The largest indirect effects were found for leading an active way of life. The study suggests that there are positive relations between character strengths and subjective but also physical well-being. Furthermore, potential mechanisms, which might account for these relations (i.e. health-behaviors) are assessed.},

The present study aimed at testing this assumed causality in a random-assignment, placebo-controlled web-based intervention study. The intervention group (n = 83) was instructed to use their four highest character strengths more often at work for 4 weeks. Meanwhile the control group (n = 69) reflected about four situations (independent from the current workplace) where they excelled. For the evaluation of the effects of the two conditions, participants completed measures on calling and global life satisfaction before (Pretest), directly after the four-week training period (Posttest 1), and 3 (Posttest 2) and 6 months (Posttest 3) later. Calling significantly increased in the intervention group but not in the control group from Pretest to Posttest 1, and remained constant until Posttest 3. Global life satisfaction significantly increased in the intervention group but not in the control group from Pretest to Posttest 2 and from Posttest 1 to Posttest 3. That indicated that the changes on global life satisfaction were less steep than the changes in calling and lagged, but significant long lasting changes were observed likewise. Results supported the assumption that the application of strengths at work impacts calling and life satisfaction. Limitations as well as implications for research and practice are discussed.},

Aims: This paper describes an adapted Hungarian version of the 24-item Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for adults. Methods: Participants in three online self-report questionnaire-based cross-sectional studies (Sn = 10,911) filled in the 24-item Values in Action Inventory of Strengths, the Global Well-being Scale, Huppert's and Diener's Flourishing Scales, and the Positivity Scale. Results: The exploratory factor analyses provided evidence for four factors: Wisdom and Knowledge; Humanity; Temperance; and Spirituality and Transcendence. The scales showed excellent internal consistency values in each study. The confirmatory factor analyses of the subsamples also showed a good fit. Low discriminant but excellent content validity was proved. Participants rated themselves highest on Humanity and lowest on Temper-ance. Women reported significantly higher values on both the Humanity and the Spirituality and Transcendence virtue scales than did men. The Wisdom and Knowledge virtue showed a positive correlation with educa-tion level. Among those living alone, Humanity was significantly lower, while the level of Humanity among married people stood significantly higher than in any other group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the Hungarian version of the 24-item Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for adults serves as a suitable meas-ure for assessing character strengths and virtues.},

Most research on character strengths has been conducted with youths in Western cultures. We examined character strengths in relation to positive and negative well-being indicators in a sample of Iranian youths. We investigated the reliability and validity of the Farsi version of the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth (VIA Y-96)-a self-report survey commonly used in Western contexts. Participants were adolescents in Iran (N = 1,359; 48.5% female; M age = 13.54, SD = 1.00) who completed the VIA Y-96 and questionnaires assessing life satisfaction, positive/negative experiences, depression, anxiety, and stress. We found that reliability coefficients were acceptable for most of the VIA subscales. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), as well as a second-order CFA, supported the construct validity of the Farsi VIA Y-96. Correlations between the character strengths and positive and negative well-being indicators supported convergent validity. Measurement invariance for the VIA Y-96 was established in this study comparing boys' and girls' response patterns. Sex and grade level differences were found for some of the subscales. Overall, the Farsi VIA Y-96 had acceptable psychometric properties, suggesting that it can be used in research on character strengths with Iranian youths.},

  abstract={Several studies demonstrated the relevance of character strengths in the workplace. For example, it has been shown that they positively relate to performance and are strong predictors of job satisfaction. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that occupational groups differ in their average levels of character strengths. However, little is known about the effects of the congruence between a person's strengths profile with the average profile within an occupational group (environmental congruence) on well-being. In a nationally representative sample (N= 870) of employed adults, we analyzed data on character strengths (t1), and measures of job and life satisfaction at three different time points (t1-t3; separated by 1 year). We studied (1) whether employees in different occupational groups differ with regard to their levels and configurations of character strengths, (2) how levels and configurations of character strengths relate to concurrent and predictive job and life satisfaction, and (3) whether a fit between strengths of a person and the environment goes along with current and future job and life satisfaction. Results confirmed previous findings that small, but meaningful, differences in character strengths among employees in different occupational groups can be found and that character strengths positively relate to current and prospective job and life satisfaction. Furthermore, results suggested that a better person-environment fit goes along with higher job and life satisfaction. These results suggest character strengths and could play an important role in vocational and career counseling.},

Little is known about the effect of circadian rhythm on psychological distress. Objective To investigate the type of circadian rhythm in Chinese AYA cancer survivors and examine the associations among chronotype, demographic characteristics, psychological distress, anxiety and depression, character strengths, and medical coping in this group. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 800 AYA cancer participants, 728 of whom completed the Chinese version of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, the Distress Thermometer, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Three-Dimensional Inventory of Character Strengths, and the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire. Results Evening- and morning-type participants accounted for 35.0% and 19.1%, respectively, among participants, which was significantly higher than those found in the general population. The prevalence of psychological distress was 84.9% among AYA cancer participants. Exercise, Distress Thermometer, and depression were important predictive factors for the circadian rhythm. Conclusions Circadian rhythm disorder and psychological distress were common among AYA cancer survivors. Evening-type participants performed worse on character strength, confrontation, and avoidance of medical coping. Implications for practice Healthcare professionals need to understand the circadian rhythm and psychological health of AYA cancer survivors. Psychological rehabilitation guidance, especially within the 6 months after diagnosis, may benefit AYA survivors according to their chronotype. Character strengths can also be used during rehabilitation to properly guide AYA survivors.},

  abstract={The Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS; Peterson, Park, & Seligman, 2005a) is an English-language self-report questionnaire that measures 24 widely-valued character strengths. The present paper describes the creation and adaptation of the German version of the VIA-IS and its peer-rating form using a sample of 1,674 adults. The 24 subscales had high reliability (median alpha = .77; median corrected item-total correlations = .45) and high stability across 9 months (median test-retest correlation = .73). The VIA-IS peer form also had high reliability (median alpha = .81). Self-and peer-ratings of strengths converged as expected (median correlation = .40), and on average ordered the strengths in the same way, correlating .88 across the 24 strengths. There were low to modest correlations of the VIA subscales with demographic variables. Neither the VIA-IS nor the VIA-IS Peer was strongly influenced by social desirability. Correlations with three different measures of subjective well-being replicated findings from earlier studies of the original English VIA-IS and supported the validity of the scale. Furthermore, relations to self-reported behavior and contentment with various aspects of life were modest but congruent with the meaning of the scales (e. g., higher endorsement of religion among spiritual participants, less cigarette smoking among participants with higher self-regulation). Overall, the German VIA-IS and VIA-IS Peer demonstrated good psychometric properties and promising validity evidence. These scales can be recommended for the assessment of strengths of character in the German-speaking world.},

  abstract={Character strengths are basic psychological ingredients that enable us to act in ways that enhance our well-being and life satisfaction. Despite research linking strength-based behavior to psychological health, few studies have examined their role within treatment. This study utilized a large and diverse sample of treatment-seeking university students to examine three specific questions: 1) what are the relationships between character strengths and symptom, social role, and interpersonal relationship impairment at intake? 2) do character strengths predict treatment outcome? 3) do signature strengths predict number of sessions completed? Participants completed a measure of strengths at intake and an outcome-based measure at intake and at every subsequent psychotherapy session. Results demonstrated the importance of Zest in relation to all subscales, being an excellerator of treatment progress and associated with better and faster treatment outcome and completion. Other findings of note include the protective factor of Love of Learning in this population, the paradoxical relationship between outcome and Persistence, Justice and Perseverance as overall predictors of better outcomes, and Hope as a predictor of less sessions completed. Clinical and research implications are discussed throughout.},

A sample of 247 students (mean age = 12 years) completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth, and measures on school-related satisfaction and academic self-efficacy. Teacher-ratings on positive classroom behavior, and grades from students' school reports were also collected. Love of learning, zest, gratitude, perseverance, and curiosity were positively associated with school-related satisfaction. Hope, love of learning, perseverance, prudence, and others were positively associated with academic self-efficacy. Character strengths of the mind (e.g., self-regulation, perseverance, love of learning) were predictive for school success. The good character explained about one fourth of the variance in positive classroom behavior, with the specific strengths of perseverance, love of learning, and prudence showing the most substantial positive correlations. A model that postulated the predictive power of classroom-relevant character strengths on school success, mediated through positive classroom behavior, was supported. Character strengths (e.g., perspective, gratitude, hope, self-regulation, teamwork) distinguished between students who demonstrated improved vs. decreased grades during the school year. This study shows that the good character clearly matters in different contexts at school, and it seems to be relevant for subjective (e.g., satisfaction) as well as objective (e.g., grades) outcomes, and for positive behavior in classrooms.},

  abstract={Positive psychology deals with factors that make life most worth living and focuses on enhancing individual potentials. Particularly, character strengths can positively contribute to well-being and work-related health, bearing a promising potential for professions, such as physicians, who are at risk for burnout or mental illnesses. This study aims to identify beneficial character strengths by examining the quantitative and qualitative data. In a cross-sectional multi-method study, 218 hospital physicians completed an online survey assessing their character strengths and their general and work-related well-being, comprising thriving, work engagement, and burnout dimensions (outcome variables). Quantitative data were analyzed for the total sample and by tertiary split. Additionally, interview-gathered opinions of four resident physicians and four medical specialist educators were collected to expand the perspective on which character strengths might be beneficial for the well-being of the resident physicians. The highest significant correlations between character strengths and outcome variables were found for hope and thriving (r = 0.67), zest, and work engagement (r = 0.67) as well as emotional exhaustion (r = -0.47), perseverance/leadership and depersonalization (r = -0.27), bravery, and reduced personal accomplishment (r = -0.39). Tertiary splits revealed that some correlations were not consistent across the entire scale continuum, for example, creativity was only significantly correlated with comparatively high levels of thriving (r = 0.28) or forgiveness with comparatively high levels of depersonalization (r = -0.34). Humility, social intelligence, and teamwork showed predominantly low correlations with all outcome variables (r = -0.17 - 0.34), although humility was stated by all interviewed medical specialist educators to be the most relevant for the well-being at work, and the latter two by three resident physicians, respectively. Different perspectives resulting from quantitative and qualitative data in terms of beneficial character strengths for work-related well-being may be driven by different work experiences, professional understandings, generational beliefs, or social expectations. Some significant correlations between character strengths and well-being outcomes varied depending on low, medium, or high outcomes. This raises questions about suitable work-related well-being interventions, as simple single intervention approaches (one intervention fits all) may not work for the respective outcome levels. These new findings warrant further research on how to foster the well-being of resident physicians at work.},

  abstract={Character strengths profiles in the specific setting of medical professionals are widely unchartered territory. This paper focused on an overview of character strengths profiles of medical professionals (medical students and physicians) based on literature research and available empirical data illustrating their impact on well-being and work engagement. A literature research was conducted and the majority of peer-reviewed considered articles dealt with theoretical or conceptually driven 'virtues' associated with medical specialties or questions of ethics in patient care (e.g., professionalism, or what makes a good physician). The virtues of compassion, courage, altruism, and benevolence were described most often. Only a limited number of papers addressed character strengths of medical students or physicians according to the VIA-classification. Those articles showed that the VIA-character strengths fairness, honesty, kindness, and teamwork were considered most often by respondents to be particularly important for the medical profession. Available cross-sectional (time span: six years) and longitudinal (time span: three years) data regarding VIA-character strengths profiles of medical professionals were analyzed (N = 584 medical students, 274 physicians). These profiles were quite homogenous among both groups. The character strengths fairness, honesty, judgment, kindness, and love had the highest means in both samples. Noteworthy differences appeared when comparing medical specialties, in particular concerning general surgeons and psychiatrists, with the former reporting clearly higher levels of e.g., honesty (d = 1.02) or prudence (d = 1.19). Long-term results revealed significant positive effects of character strengths on well-being and work engagement (e.g., perseverance on physicians' work engagement) but also significant negative effects (e.g., appreciation of beauty and excellence on students' well-being). Further, hope was significantly associated both positively with physicians' well-being and negatively with students' work engagement, possibly indicating specific issues concerning medical education or hospital working conditions. According to the modern-day physician's pledge, medical professionals should pay attention to their own well-being and health. Therefore, promoting self-awareness and character building among medical professionals could be a beneficial strategy.},

The present study aimed to explore character strengths that were independently related to fewer behavior problems in early adolescents. In total, 521 early adolescents (mean age 10.92 +/- 0.04, range 10-12 years) were recruited from primary schools in Sichuan, China. Character strengths were measured using the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth (VIA-Youth). Behavior problems were measured using the Conners Parent Symptom Questionnaire (PSQ). The results showed that behavior problems were negatively correlated with character strengths (r = -0.14 to -0.3, p < 0.05 Bonferroni corrected). Character strengths explained a significant proportion of additional variance (14-22%) in five types of behavior problems after controlling the effect of demographic factors (residence, left-behind experiences, maternal education level). Moreover, several specific character strengths showed an independent contribution (beta = -0.34 to -0.14 for self-regulation, perseverance, zest, humility, and leadership; beta = 0.21 to 0.34, for hope; all p < 0.05) to behavior problems. Our study revealed that character strengths were protective factors against behavior problems in early adolescents.},

The factorial structure of the DPES was examined on item level. Joy and contentment could not be clearly separated; the items of the other five emotions loaded on separate factors. A confirmatory factor analysis assuming two latent factors (self-oriented and object/situation specific) was computed on scale level. Results confirmed the existence of these factors, but also indicated that the seven emotions did not split up into two clearly separable families. Correlations between dispositional positive emotions and character strengths were positive and generally low to moderate; a few theoretically meaningful strengths-emotions pairs yielded coefficients > .40. Finally, the link between five character strengths factors (i.e. emotional strengths, interpersonal strengths, strengths of restraint, intellectual strengths, and theological strengths) and the emotional dispositions was examined. Each of the factors displayed a distinctive "emotional pattern"; emotional strengths evidenced the most numerous and strongest links to emotional dispositions.},

Further, the desirability of certain strengths (e.g., perseverance, fairness, forgiveness, and humor) at the classroom level accounted for additional variance in students' well-being. Study 2 (N = 186, mean age = 14.27 years) used a diary design across five days to replicate the between-person associations and study within-person associations. Results revealed that daily strengths-related behavior predicted well-being on the following day.

If pre and post measures in life satisfaction were compared, the group with the strengths most correlated with life satisfaction improved significantly (statistically) in their satisfaction in comparison to a control group. This could be interpreted as support for the idea that primarily those strengths that correlate highly with life satisfaction should be addressed in strengths-based interventions. When asked for subjective ratings of well-being after the interventions concluded, participants in both intervention groups indicated gains above that of a wait-listed control group. Further analyses underscore the special role of self-regulation in facilitating success in the interventions.

Using polynomial regression with response surface mapping, results indicated that honesty and kindness, love and social intelligence, and hope and gratitude had the strongest relations to meaning in life when both pairs were in agreement. When one character strength was higher than its pair, this predicted lower levels of meaning in life. The exception was bravery and fairness where the degree of discrepancy predicted meaning life when bravery was higher than fairness. These results suggest that balance among character strengths is important for meaning in life.},

Specifically, we analyze the relationship between LS and character strengths, controlling for gender, age, socioeconomic status, and family structure. Participants were 659 adolescents (43.1% female) aged between 12 and 18 years who completed the Students' Life Satisfaction Scale (SLSS) and the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth (VIA-Y). Their parents or legal guardians completed the Survey of Socioeconomic Stratification (SSES). Correlation analysis and regression modeling were performed. Results showed that LS was not related to age or socioeconomic status, but there was a significant association with gender and family structure, insofar as boys and adolescents living in intact families reported higher levels of LS. Overall, the majority of character strengths were positively related to LS. After eliminating overlap between strengths and controlling for sociodemographic variables, the strengths of hope, zest, love, and prudence significantly predicted LS. We discuss how these strengths, related to the cognitive component of well-being, may play a protective role against difficulties during adolescence. Character strengths-based interventions are proposed to promote healthy development in Ecuadorian adolescents.},

  abstract={Background: So far, studies on workplace mental health have only focused on work-related environmental risk factors, disregarding both protective and individual factors of employees. Therefore, we aimed to identify character strengths that act as protective factors against depressive moods and suicidality in Korean employees.        Methods: In total, 84 male and 151 female employees (aged 19-50 years) reported their sociodemographic characteristics; depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II; suicidality, as measured by the Korean version of the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview suicidality module; and character strengths, as measured by the 24 Character Strength Alphas on the Values in Action Survey-72. We conducted a hierarchical logistic regression, in which depressive mood and suicidality served as the categorical outcome variables.        Results: In females, scores on the "curiosity" (B = 1.107, Wald = 10.207, odds ratio = 3.026, p = .001) and "love" (B = .862, Wald = 5.767, odds ratio = 2.367, p = .016) sub scales of the 24 Character Strength Alphas on the Values in Action Survey-72 were statistically significant predictors of having depressive mood. Additionally, females' scores on "judgment" (B = -1. 405, Wald = 5.663, odds ratio = .245, p = .017) and "kindness" (B = -1.456, Wald = 6.486, odds ratio = .233, p = .011) were protective factors against suicidality. In males, the "love" (B = 1.746, Wald = 4.279, odds ratio = 5.729, p = .039) score was a predictor of having depressive mood, while "teamwork" (B = -2.204, Wald = 4.666, odds ratio = .110, p = .031) and "creativity" (B = -1.384, Wald = 4.202, odds ratio = .251, p = .040) scores were protective factors against having depressive mood and suicidality, respectively.        Conclusions: We suggest that focusing on "judgement" and "kindness" in female employees, and " teamwork" and "creativity" in male employees, and engaging in activities that use these strengths at the workplace can be protective factors against depression and suicidality. Future research should focus on developing interventions to promote these character strengths among employees at the workplace.},

  abstract={The present study examined the efficacy of a strength-based intervention program among Chinese undergraduates to increase satisfaction with life. A total of 285 undergraduates enrolled in an 18-week elective course participated in this study. A 2 (informed about the purposes of the intervention vs. not informed about the purposes of the intervention) x 2 (strength-training intervention vs. experiential control) experimental design was adopted. The Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) was completed during week two of the course to obtain the personal character strengths profile of each participant. The Satisfaction with Life Scale was adopted as an indicator for this study. Baseline (2nd week), short-term post-test (9th week), and long-term follow-up (18th week) test scores were obtained. All participants increased their satisfaction with life from the baseline to the peaks after the 6-week interventions, and then showed a slow downward trend. In the short-term, the students who were informed about the purpose of the study, as well as those in the strength-training group exhibited more increase in satisfaction with life. However, in the long-term, only those students in the strength-training group sustained the change in satisfaction with life. Strength-based intervention to promote satisfaction with life among Chinese undergraduates was effective. Placebo effect gradually decreased with the passage of time, and eventually disappeared. The results can facilitate the easy-to-use positive intervention in university context.},

  abstract={Background Suicide is a global issue among the elderly. The number of older people committing suicide is proliferating, and the elderly suicide rate is the highest among all age groups in China. A better understanding of the possible protective factors against suicidal ideation is necessary to facilitate prevention and intervention efforts. The objectives of the present study are threefold. First, this study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the three-dimensional inventory of character strengths (TICS) with a sample of older adults. Second, this study intends to investigate correlations among suicide ideation, wellbeing, and character strengths. Third, the study seeks to explore the possible protective roles of the three character strengths and wellbeing in explaining suicidal ideation among older adults. Methods A cross-sectional study comprising 308 older adults aged at least 50 years old from nursing homes was conducted. Four questionnaires, namely, the TICS, the Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale-10 items, the Brief Inventory of Thriving, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale, were used. Exploratory structural equation modeling, intraclass correlation coefficients, partial correlations, and sets of hierarchical regressions were adopted to estimate and report the results. Results TICS could be used to assess the character strengths (i.e., caring, inquisitiveness, and self-control) among older adults with an acceptable goodness-of-fit (chi square = 157.30, df = 63, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.07, 90% CI = [0.06, 0.08]). Wellbeing and character strengths exhibited a negative association with suicidal ideation among older adults. Moreover, character strengths showed an independently cross-sectional relationship with suicidal ideation, explaining 65.1% of the variance of suicidal ideation after controlling for the wellbeing and demographics. Conclusion This study indicated that character strengths were associated with low levels of suicidal ideation. Therefore, the protective factors against suicidal ideation among older adults should be given additional attention.},

  abstract={The study of positive traits or strengths has been the cornerstone of positive psychology. Positive psychology assumes that positive variables are different in nature from psychopathological variables and they do not necessarily improve with a usual psychotherapeutic treatment. They would require another type of intervention to progress: a positive intervention. Studies on character strengths in the clinical population are very scarce and, in general, focused on depression. Previous studies found that higher levels of hope, vitality, spirituality and leadership strengths were related to lower levels of anxiety and depression. In addition, lower levels of gratitude have been linked to symptoms of depression. The study of strengths and progress during treatment is very limited, whereas the relationship between strengths of character and treatment process has not yet been investigated. This research aims to: 1) study the 24 character strengths in adult patients who are at different stages of a naturalistic cognitive behavioral treatment; and 2) to analyze the relationship of character strengths with progress during treatment, therapeutic alliance and adherence to treatment from the therapist's perspective. Therapist's report has proven to be a very valuable source of information about the therapeutic process and outcome. An intentional sample of 85 adult outpatients (25 men and 60 women) was used and their respective therapists (11 men and 7 women). Patients had mainly anxiety, depressive or comorbid anxiety-depressive disorders; 22 were in the initial stage, 46 in the intermediate stage and 17 in the final stage of treatment.They completed a demographic and treatment datasheet, the Inventory of Strengths and Virtues and the therapist filled in an opinion survey. The study was cross-sectional. The treatment was cognitive-behavioral. The therapists did not receive any training or instruction during study, the treatment was "as usual". Stages of treatment, initial, intermediate or final, were assigned by the therapist. The results showed that patients in the final stage have greater self-regulation strength. In this strength, there are no differences between patients at initial and intermediate stages of treatment but it increases significantly in the group that was finishing treatment. It should also be noted that in the 23 remaining strengths there are no differences among patients at the different stages of treatment. Patients with depression had lower strengths of openmindedness and forgiveness compared to patients with anxiety disorders and comorbid anxiety-depressive disorders. Those patients who had had a previous psychiatric treatment had lower levels of Persistence strength. However, no differences were found between patients who had a previous psychological treatment and those who had not. A longer duration of treatment was associated with higher levels of leadership and curiosity strengths, while greater psychological distress was associated with a decrease in a high number of strengths. The strength spirituality was found to be significantly associated with progress in treatment according to the therapist. A greater open-mindedness was associated with better adherence to schedules, suggestions and therapeutic alliance according to the therapist's opinion.The association between character strengths and the therapist's opinion has been mild to moderate, which is expected for being a hetero-report.        This has been the first study to compare the character strengths between patients at different stages of a naturalistic psychotherapeutic treatment and to include patients with anxiety disorders. This research provided a first approach to the relationship between character strengths and the therapist's perception of progress in therapy and some treatment process related variables. The study of positive functioning in patients will enrich clinical psychology to become a more integrative discipline. In this way, the goal of therapy will not only be to alleviate the negative symptoms, but also to help individuals build a full life.},

  abstract={Natural disasters have increased exponentially in recent decades, imposing existential threats to humans. Yet, surprisingly little research has explored the role of religion and spirituality (R/S) and transcendence-related character strengths in post-disaster depression. Using data (N = 491) from victims of Category 5 Hurricane Michael, this study examined whether R/S factors and character strengths helped to buffer against post-disaster depressive symptoms. A hierarchical regression model revealed an inverse association of perceived spiritual support with depression, after adjusting for demographic and event-related factors; strength of faith and the use of prayer for coping were not significantly related with depression. Upon inclusion of character strengths into the model, those relationships changed dramatically. Hope and optimism negatively predicted depression, whereas strength of faith and prayer for coping did so positively. Follow-up moderation analyses found that victims reporting particularly high levels of R/S factors and particularly low levels of character strength experienced the most depressive symptoms. The findings suggest that the potential protection of R/S factors in disasters may actually be due to transcendence-related character strength factors.},

  abstract={Purpose: From the perspective of positive psychology, our study aimed to explore depressive symptoms and psychological well-being among Chinese nurses, as well as analyze the impacts of character strengths, self-efficacy and social support on the mental health of nurses.        Methods: A cross-sectional and descriptive design using five self-reported questionnaires was used to investigate a cohort of 4238 nurses during 2018. A structural equation modeling analysis was used to verify a hypothetical model linking character strengths, self-efficacy, social support, depressive symptoms, and psychological well-being.        Results: The prevalence of depression among this cohort of Chinese nurses was 58.1%. The mean scores for caring, inquisitiveness, and self-control were 19.93 (SD = 2.82), 15.94 (SD = 3.00), and 16.34 (SD = 2.95), respectively. The hypothesized model was a good fit of the data (c2/df = 1.77, p = .183, root mean square error of approximation = 0.04, goodness of fit index = 1.00, comparative fit index = 1.00, Tucker-Lewis index = 1.00). Except for the path from self-control to depression, the other hypothetical paths investigated were statistically significant.        Conclusion: Character strengths were directly and positively associated with psychological well-being. Inquisitiveness was the strongest direct protective factor for depression. In addition, character strengths indirectly alleviated depression and increased psychological well-being through mediating variables of social support and self-efficacy. This study should alert nurse managers that more attention should be paid to the character strengths and mental health of nurses. This study provides evidence for interventions based on character strengths as a management strategy to support the mental health of nurses. (c) 2020 Korean Society of Nursing Science.

This period is often characterized by high levels of stress and uncertainty, which can increase the risk of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between emerging adulthood dimensions, well-being, character strengths and depression, as well as to verify the differences in the levels of these elements among different groups of depressive symptomatology.MethodsParticipants were 1,060 individuals (741 females, 305 males) between the ages of 18 and 30 years (M = 22.3, SD = 3.72). Spearman's correlation, linear regression, and Kruskal- Wallis with pairwise post-hoc analyses were used to analyze the data.ResultsThere were significant positive correlations between emerging adulthood dimensions, well-being, and character strengths, and negative correlations between these variables and depression. There were also significant differences in the means of the evaluated constructs among the symptomm groups.DiscussionThe findings suggest that emerging adulthood dimensions, well-being, and character strengths are all associated with depression in emerging adults and have important implications for the provision of interventions in health and education for emerging adults. The study provides a deeper understanding of the factors influencing depression during emerging adulthood and emphasize the importance of promoting positive psychology elements and developing personalized interventions for emerging adults. This also suggest that public policies related to mental health and education should take into account the unique needs of emerging adults.},

Exploratory analyses also assessed changes in character strengths over time after loss. Results indicated that depression generally decreased over time and was unrelated to loss. Further, higher scores on the examined strengths predicted resilience, in that they predicted consistently lower levels of depression and impairment over time, regardless of loss. Thus, the seven examined strengths appeared to protect against depression and impairment over time. The loss group demonstrated higher levels of hope and gratitude across time points. Consistent with the concept of post-traumatic growth, results suggest that these strengths may be particularly salient when confronted with loss. Contrary to predictions of post-traumatic growth theory, however, there was little change in strengths over time.},

  abstract={Personality traits have often been highlighted to relate to how people cope with stressful events. The present paper focuses on character strengths as positive personality traits and examines two basic assumptions that were derived from a core characteristic of character strengths (i.e., to determine how individuals deal with adversities): (1) character strengths correlate with coping and (2) buffer the effects of work-related stress on job satisfaction. Two different samples (i.e., a mixed sample representing various occupations = 214] and a nurses sample [N = 175]) filled in measures for character strengths, coping, work-related stress, and job satisfaction. As expected, intellectual, emotional, and interpersonal strengths were related to coping. Interpersonal strengths played a greater role for coping among nurses, as interactions with others are an essential part of their workday. Furthermore, intellectual strengths partially mediated the negative effect of work-related stress on job satisfaction. These findings open a new field for research on the role of personality in coping with work-related stress. Character strengths are trainable personal characteristics, and therefore valuable resources to improve coping with work-related stress and to decrease the negative effects of stress. Further research is needed to investigate this assumed causality.},

  abstract={Pacific Island Countries are particularly vulnerable to the environmental and economic consequences of climate change including both direct and indirect impacts on individuals' mental health. There is a need to better understand the links between environmental attitudes, pro-environmental behaviours, and well-being in this region and to develop cost-effective, culturally informed interventions. The present study explored the level of environmental concerns and attitudes among Pacific Island university students and how this relates to their overall well-being, the nature of their current pro-environmental actions, and the potential for individuals' character strengths to predict pro-environmental attitudes. College students (n = 269) from six Pacific Island Countries completed a survey measuring their character strengths, well-being, and environmental support. As expected, the young adults had very high levels of concern about environmental threats, and this was related to their overall well-being. The young adults felt a personal responsibility to protect the environments around their local communities, which suggests national climate change strategies should be embedded within this localised context. Character strengths were highly valued among the Pacific Island sample and showed some association with (specifically) support for environmental actions and policies. Given the high levels of environmental concern in the sample, the character strengths approach likely provides a bridge between emotional engagement and active allyship in some individuals. Therefore, further research should investigate the role of character strengths in empowering pacific students to play a more leading role in policy change.},

  abstract={Accessible Summary        What is known on the subject?        The role of informal caregiver can have both negative and positive consequences for a person's well-being. The main theoretical framework for explaining these consequences is the stress process model, which considers contextual variables, stressors and mediating/moderating factors. The latter are psychosocial factors such as coping strategies, personal mastery, social support or beliefs and values which may influence caregiver well-being. The perception of gains in caregiving has also been proposed as a mediating variable since it may act as a coping strategy. However, few studies have examined values and perceived gains as mediating variables with life satisfaction as the outcome.        What the paper adds to existing knowledge?        This study explores the role of character strengths and caregiver gains as mediators between stressors and life satisfaction in informal caregivers of persons with dementia. The results identify hope as a key character strength, its lack being one pathway through which stress may lead to low life satisfaction and low perceived gains from caregiving.        What are the implications for practice?        Caregivers who experience a lack of hope may be less able to generate goals and be less motivated to achieve them. Our findings are relevant to gerontological nursing based on the Senses Framework as they confirm the importance of the senses of purpose and achievement. Nursing and care staff can play an active role in helping informal caregivers to meet their goals by promoting these two senses, thereby fostering a more positive caregiving experience.        Introduction        Being an informal caregiver can have both negative and positive consequences for well-being. Within the framework of the stress process model, few studies have examined values and perceived gains of caregiving as mediating variables of life satisfaction.        Aim        To explore the role of character strengths and perceived gains as mediators in the association between life satisfaction and primary and secondary stressors in informal caregivers of persons with dementia.        Method        Participants were 112 informal caregivers. Hierarchical regression, correlation and mediation analyses were performed.        Results        Lower life satisfaction was associated with being female, unmarried, caring for someone with greater cognitive impairment, a higher level of stress, having restricted leisure time and perceiving financial difficulties. Hope mediated the associations between perceived stress and both life satisfaction and perceived gains of caregiving.        Discussion        Hope is a key strength and its lack is one pathway through which stress may cause low satisfaction and low perceived gains from caregiving.        Implications for practice        Without hope, it is difficult for caregivers to generate goals and be motivated to achieve them. Nursing and care staff should aim to promote a sense of purpose and achievement among informal caregivers so as to foster a more positive caring experience.},

  abstract={Adolescence is a crucial time period with especial vulnerability for development of mental health problems. Growing interest is focusing on the determinants of positive mental health in order to find the key concepts that could be influenced in the promotion of mental well-being of adolescents. In this study we aim to explore the relations between self-esteem, character strengths and experience of social inclusion as determinants of adolescents' positive mental health controlled for selected sociodemographic background factors. The study population (n = 195) consisted of comprehensive school students who filled in an electronic questionnaire of adolescent's mental well-being in Fall 2019. The questionnaire included measures of Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), VIA Youth-measure 96, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Experience of Social Inclusion Scale. The methods included group comparisons and General Linear Model computed by SPSS 24.0. The strongest association was found between positive mental health and self-esteem (beta = 0.789, p < 0.001), followed by character strengths of hope and kindness and experience of social inclusion. Interestingly, family's socioeconomic factors did not associate significantly with positive mental health in the final statistical model. In terms of our results, it seems that self-esteem, character strengths and experience of social inclusion might have stronger association with adolescents' mental well-being than family's socioeconomic determinants. Therefore, it should be discussed whether psychological determinants overcome the individual effect of poor socioeconomic status as factors that influence positive mental health. Further studies are needed to establish these results more firmly.},

  abstract={Accessible Summary What is known on the subject? Prior research has demonstrated that childhood trauma can increase adolescents' suicidal ideation, and perceived stress plays a mediating role in the relationship between childhood trauma and adolescents' suicidal ideation. Character strengths, which are trait-like positive personality characteristics, have also been found to be closely related to decreased stress and suicidal ideation. However, it is unclear whether character strengths act as a transfer mechanism that links childhood traumatic experiences with perceived stress and eventually suicidal ideation. What the paper adds to existing knowledge? This study found that character strengths and perceived stress serially mediated the association between childhood trauma and suicidal ideation. Specifically, childhood trauma was associated with inferior character strengths, and the impaired character strengths further triggered high perceived stress, which was finally linked to a heightened risk of suicidal ideation. This study provided important theoretical implications for preventing suicidal risk among adolescents who are exposed to traumatic events during childhood. What are the implications for practice? This study highlighted the roles of character strengths and perceived stress in the relationship between childhood traumatic experiences and suicidal ideation, which provided suggestions for designing nursing interventions to reduce adolescents' suicidal ideation, especially for those with traumatic childhood experiences. In addition to family nursing, school-based regular monitoring and interventions of character strengths and perceived stress are necessary. AimThis study sought to examine the mediating effects of character strengths and perceived stress on the relationship between childhood trauma and suicidal ideation among adolescents. MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 1069 Chinese adolescents. The Chinese versions of the Suicidal Ideation Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale and Character Scale for Adolescents were used to assess adolescents' suicidal ideation, childhood trauma, perceived stress and character strengths. ResultsThe findings showed that childhood trauma influenced suicidal ideation directly and indirectly via perceived stress. Moreover, character strengths and perceived stress serially mediated the association between childhood trauma and suicidal ideation, implying that childhood trauma was associated with inferior character strengths, and the impaired character strengths further triggered high perceived stress, which was finally linked to a heightened risk of suicidal ideation. ConclusionsThis study highlighted the joint contribution of childhood trauma, character strengths and perceived stress to suicidal ideation, providing theoretical and practical implications to guide mental health nurses to reduce the suicide risk among adolescents. Implications for PracticeThese findings highlighted the importance of developing character strengths and stress-coping strategies. Family nursing and school-based regular monitoring and interventions of character strengths and perceived stress are necessary among adolescents who exposed to a high level of childhood trauma experiences to reduce their suicidal ideation and foster mental health.},

  abstract={This article reports the development and psychometric properties of the 12-item Encouragement Character Strength Scale (ECSS), a measure of the character strength of encouragement using diverse samples (e.g., noncollege adults, Latinx-majority college students, and psychotherapists). The encouragement character strength is the enjoyment and perceived ability to express affirmations to motivate others. This character strength is relevant to counseling psychology because of the latter's historical embrace of human strengths and encouragement's importance in many counseling psychology applications, such as psychotherapy and supervision. Bifactor modeling provided evidence for a general factor and for measurement invariance across race and gender. Ancillary bifactor indices suggest that ECSS should be treated as a unidimensional measure. Criterion-related evidence of validity for ECSS was demonstrated through positive correlations with secure attachment, generativity, empathy, kindness, optimism, social connectedness, the personality traits of agreeableness and extraversion, psychological well-being, and a strength-based focus in psychotherapy (for therapists). Discriminant evidence of validity revealed small correlations with impression management and self-deception enhancement. Incremental evidence of validity showed unique, positive correlations with psychological well-being and generativity, after controlling for other variables. Moreover, self-reported ECSS scores were correlated with positive features of written encouragement messages and with other-reported ECSS scores, providing support for heteromethod convergent validity. The authors also found evidence for ECSS's internal consistency and temporal stability.},

  abstract={Teamwork has been argued to play an increasingly important role in numerous jobs, and several studies focused on the effects of team composition for work-related outcomes. Recent research has also identified individuals' character strengths and positive team roles (e.g., idea creator and relationship manager) as conducive to work-related outcomes. However, there is a scarcity of research on the role of character strengths or positive team roles on the level of teams. In the present study, we extend theoretical assumptions of team role theories to the study of character strengths and positive team roles: We examined the associations between character strengths and team roles with work-related outcomes on the individual (i.e., job satisfaction, self- and supervisor-rated performance) and the team level (i.e., teamwork quality, self- and supervisor-rated team performance). Further, we examined how the team composition relates to the outcomes, that is, whether balanced teams (i.e., all team roles or character strengths are represented in the current team) go along with desired outcomes and whether an overrepresentation of team roles or character strengths in a team (i.e., a team role or character strengths is represented by multiple team members) goes along with undesired outcomes. We studied a sample of 42 teams (N = 284 individuals) who completed measures of team roles, character strengths, teamwork quality, job satisfaction, and self-rated individual and team performance. Further, supervisor ratings of individual and team performance were collected. Results corroborated the relationships of team roles and character strengths with individual outcomes such as that specific roles and character strengths go along with individual performance and work satisfaction. Further, the results suggested that teams in which more team roles are represented report higher performance and teamwork quality. Also, teams with higher average levels of the character strengths of teamwork and fairness, and teams with more members scoring high in fairness and prudence report higher teamwork quality. Further, there is no evidence that having too many members with a particular character strength has detrimental effects on teamwork quality, work satisfaction, or performance. We conclude that extending the study of character to the level of teams offers an important advancement.},

Results showed that, similar to life satisfaction, zest, hope, curiosity, love, and gratitude, and emotional strengths in general, related most strongly to overall job satisfaction. However, the relationships of the strengths with job satisfaction differed depending on the facet of job satisfaction, the occupational subgroup, and the age group under study. Knowing which individual strengths as well as strengths factors are more important for specific working populations can help to develop and apply more effective strength-based interventions in the workplace, thus improving positive and reducing negative work-related outcomes.},

ResultsThe scores of hope, judgement, perspective, and transcendence of the PCOS group were significantly higher in comparison with healthy participants. An increase in free androgen index was negatively correlated to the score of judgement only. ConclusionWomen with PCOS have their own profile of character strengths and virtues that constitute judgement, hope, perspective, and transcendence.

However, little is known about how positive psychology can support the wellbeing of autistic people. The present study investigated character strengths profiles as a potential tool to identify strengths-based interventions that could enhance wellbeing outcomes for autistic adults. To our knowledge, this is first study to use this method as a possible way of improving the wellbeing of autistic adults in the community in the UK.Method: Forty-seven self-reported formally diagnosed (83%) and self-identifying (17%) autistic adults completed online self-rated standardised questionnaires about their character strengths and life satisfaction. Descriptive statistics and correlational analyses were used to evaluate the profile of character strengths and their relationship to overall life satisfaction.Results: Character strengths most frequently reported by autistic adults were Honesty, Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence, Love of Learning, Fairness, and Kindness. Higher levels of life satisfaction were associated with character strengths of Gratitude, Hope, and Honesty.Conclusions: The most frequent character strengths were consistent with autistic traits reported in the wider body of autism literature, such as intense interests and strong attention to detail. The present study provides preliminary findings and recommendations for potential future strengths-based interventions that could enhance life satisfaction of autistic adults in a community setting. Further investigation with larger samples is needed to replicate the emerging findings on this topic.},

Prior research has shown that character strengths contribute positively to adolescent development. However, little research has been done to investigate the relationship between adolescents' character strengths and problematic mobile phone use. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between character strengths and problematic mobile phone use, as well as the mediating roles of basic psychological needs satisfaction and resilience in this relationship. This cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2022, including 693 Chinese adolescent participants. Character strengths, basic psychological needs satisfaction, resilience, and problematic mobile phone use were measured using established scales. The results indicated that character strengths were negatively related to problematic mobile phone use, and positively related to basic psychological needs satisfaction and resilience. Furthermore, basic psychological needs satisfaction and resilience fully and respectively mediated the association between character strengths and problematic mobile phone use. Additionally, character strengths influenced adolescents' problematic mobile phone use through the serial mediating effect of basic psychological needs satisfaction and resilience. Moreover, the results also showed that sex moderated the character strengths-basic psychological needs satisfaction relationship, the basic psychological needs satisfaction-resilience relationship, and the basic psychological needs satisfaction-problematic mobile phone use relationship. The current findings provide important insights into how to prevent problematic mobile phone use among adolescents.},

A second aim was to examine whether profile membership was associated with mental health markers. We predicted that at least two qualitatively distinct profiles would emerge: the "heart" strengths profile and the "mind" strengths profile. We also predicted that a "heart" strengths profile would be more strongly associated with markers of mental health than a "mind" strengths profile. Respondents (N = 595, M-age = 34.11 years, SD = 13.18) completed measures assessing endorsement of character strengths and a range of mental health markers. A latent profile analysis identified an optimal 4-profile solution based on these six dimensions of strengths. Emergent profiles were Profile 1 (Low Strengths), Profile 2 (Mind Strengths), Profile 3 (Heart Strengths), and Profile 4 (High Strengths). As expected, profile membership was significantly associated with mental health markers. Notably, strengths of the heart (e.g., zest, hope, kindness) contributed to more favorable presentations. Therefore, cultivating strengths associated with the heart dimension might enhance mental health. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It also investigated whether the three negative effects of MS mediate the relationship of each of the character strengths and QOL. Methods Six hundred and twenty-four individuals with MS completed an online survey measuring character strengths, QOL, as measured by the Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Scale, disability, fatigue, and depression. SPSS was used to complete the correlational analysis, and Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to conduct the mediation analyses. Results The strengths endorsed most frequently by the participants were honesty, kindness, and fairness. The least-endorsed strengths were self-regulation, zest, and spirituality. The strengths with the strongest association with QOL were zest, hope, and gratitude. Disability was not found to mediate any of the relationships between character strengths and QOL. Many of the character strengths were associated with QOL both directly and indirectly through fatigue and depression. Conclusions Many of the character strengths in the Peterson and Seligman model enhance QOL in persons with MS, both directly and through their influence on negative effects of MS. The results provide support for the development of character strengths interventions to impact QOL, both directly and indirectly through improvements to MS-related symptoms such as fatigue and depression.},

  abstract={Objective: This study aimed to investigate the current prevalence and determinants of psychological distress and the association of distress with general information, character strengths, medical coping, and social support in Chinese adolescents and young adults (AYAs) aged 15-39 years with cancer. Methods: A multicenter survey was carried out. Eight hundred and nine patients completed the Chinese version of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network distress thermometer (DT), the three-dimensional inventory of character strengths, the medical coping modes questionnaire, and the Social Support Rating Scale. Results: The current prevalence of psychological distress in Chinese AYAs with cancer was 83.4'. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, educational level, marriage, monthly income, exercise intensity, cancer classifications, treatments, self-control, confrontation, avoidance, and subjective support were all associated with distress. AYA cancer patients who were female, younger, or divorced or had a lower monthly income, education level, or exercise intensity were more likely to have higher level of distress. Compared to AYAs with other cancer classifications, patients with digestive system malignancies, breast cancers, and head and neck malignancies had a higher prevalence of distress. Patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy were more likely to be distressed. The higher the self-control, confrontation, avoidance, and subjective support scores were, the lower the prevalence of distress was among AYA cancer patients. Conclusions: The prevalence of psychological distress in AYA cancer patients was relatively high. Potential interventions targeting exercise intensity, character strengths, medical coping, and social support may decrease the prevalence of psychological distress in this patient population.},

Little research has focused, however, on personal factors potentially helping individuals cope with COVID-related difficulties. This study investigates the relations between character strengths, mental health, and post-traumatic growth. Design Longitudinal (T1: April 2020; T2: December 2020-January 2021). Main outcome measures 254 Italian adults (54 males; mean age = 36.05, SD = 14.04) completed questionnaires on character and mental health at T1, and on mental health and post-traumatic growth at T2. Results General mental health was worse at T2 than at T1. Structural equation modelling showed that character, as a whole, had a significant direct effect on post-traumatic growth and mental health at T2, and an indirect effect mediated by post-traumatic growth. Furthermore, regression analyses evidenced that the virtue of transcendence was uniquely related to mental health at T2, while humanity was specifically associated with post-traumatic growth (after accounting for the other virtues). Conclusion Individuals' character strengths related to their mental health and post-traumatic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, with evidence of post-traumatic growth mediating the relation between character and mental health.},

A multistage stratified sampling method was used, and 1,221 valid questionnaires across 100 cities in 31 provinces were collected.Results: For the participants in this survey, the three dimensions of CSs ranging from high to low were caring (4.20 +/- 0.640), self-control (3.53 +/- 0.763), and inquisitiveness (3.37 +/- 0.787). There was difference in CSs scores across age (F = 8.171, P < 0.01), professional categories (F = 5.545, P < 0.01), and job tenure (F = 9.470, P < 0.01). The results showed that CSs significantly affected the psychological stress (beta = -0.365, P< 0.01), sleep quality (beta = 0.312, P< 0.01), and subjective health (beta = 0.398, P< 0.01) of nurses. Moreover, psychological stress partially mediated the association between CSs and both types of health outcomes.Conclusion: In China, the CSs of nurses are at high levels. We find that nurses with high-level CSs are likely to experience less psychological stress and exhibit healthy psycho-physiological responses, which contribute to positive health outcomes. Finally, our study argues that strength-based interventions of positive psychology in hospitals should be provided to minimize threats to the physical and psychological health of health professionals, which is a beneficial choice for future hospital reforms in the domain of occupational health management.},

However, COVID-19 pandemic might even have worsened their mental health. Thus, this article aims to evaluate how the exposure to COVID-19 pandemic has affected these students' mental health and to determine the effect of purpose in life and character strengths on this psychopathology. MethodsA cross-sectional study of unpaired samples was carried out in Spain during the first and third waves of the pandemic in 70 medical and 52 nursing students. ResultsThe risk factor that most determined the appearance of anxiety was the exposure of family and friends to COVID-19 (OR = 4.01; p < 0.001), while the most protective factors were honesty (OR = -1.14; p = 0.025) and purpose in life (OR = -0.18; p < 0.001). Purpose in life also protected against the onset of depression and total psychopathology. In addition, we observed studying medicine was a protective factor against total psychopathology while being a nursing student was associated with high levels of acute stress. ConclusionExposure of the students' family and friends to SARS-CoV-2 favored the appearance of symptoms of anxiety. Honesty had a preventing role in the onset of anxiety and a high purpose in life was protective against the appearance of anxiety, depression, and total psychopathology.},

  abstract={Recent research has utilized network analysis to identify communities of character strengths, resulting in the discovery of four communities: Discernment, Interpersonal, Responsibility, and Energy. In this study, we aimed to replicate these communities and explore their relevance to psychopathology. Prior research indicates the strengths under-overuse is superior to a positive conceptualization of strengths in explaining psychopathology. We hypothesized that under-overuse communities would provide a better understanding of depression and manic behavior than the strengths communities. In analyzing an existing international sample of 970 participants, we replicated all four strengths communities. Our findings indicate that all communities of strengths significantly explained depression, with the Energy community explaining the most variance. Additionally, all four strengths underuse communities significantly explained depression, with the Lethargic community explaining the most variance. In contrast, only the Responsibility community of strengths explained manic behavior, while all four communities of strengths overuse significantly explained manic behavior, with the Turgid community explaining the most variance. Overall, the under-overuse communities were more effective in explaining these disorders than the strengths communities, expanding and providing further support to this novel outlook on psychopathology. Future research should replicate and validate these findings and extend them to other disorders.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: The field of positive psychology has grown exponentially within the last decade. To date, however, there have been few empirical initiatives to clarify the constructs within positive psychology as they relate to rehabilitation medicine. Character strengths, and in particular resilience, following neurological trauma are clinically observable within rehabilitation settings, and greater knowledge of the way in which these factors relate to treatment variables may allow for enhanced treatment conceptualization and planning.        OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to explore the relationships between positive psychology constructs (character strengths, resilience, and positive mood) and rehabilitation-related variables (perceptions of functional ability post-injury and beliefs about treatment) within a baseline data set, a six-month follow-up data set, and longitudinally across time points.        METHODS: Pearson correlations and supplementary multiple regression analyses were conducted within and across these time points from a starting sample of thirty-nine individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI) in an outpatient rehabilitation program.        RESULTS: Positive psychology constructs were related to rehabilitation-related variables within the baseline data set, within the follow-up data set, and longitudinally between baseline positive psychology variables and follow-up rehabilitation-related data.        CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support relationships between character strengths, resilience, and positive mood states with perceptions of functional ability and expectations of treatment, respectively, which are primary factors in treatment success and quality of life outcomes in rehabilitation medicine settings. The results suggest the need for more research in this area, with an ultimate goal of incorporating positive psychology constructs into rehabilitation conceptualization and treatment planning.},

  abstract={IntroductionThe relationship between personal spirituality and character strengths has not been adequately explored. We investigate this relationship in an adult sample via latent profile analysis. MethodsSeven-hundred and sixty-three individuals aged 18 to 68years completed a survey of personal spirituality (e.g., Delaney Spirituality Scale), character strengths and virtues (e.g., VIA Inventory), flourishing (i.e., general wellbeing; PERMA Profiler), and various demographic variables (e.g., age, race, sexual orientation, yearly income, education level, religiosity, importance of spirituality and religion, and religious attendance). Latent profile analysis (LPA) was performed to identity profiles of individuals based on their reported levels personal spirituality and character strengths (i.e., VIA virtues). ResultsA best-fitting model consisting of four distinct, non-overlapping profiles emerged. In every profile, the degree of personal spirituality was consistently associated with strengths of character. Profiles that exhibited high levels of spirituality and character also reported greater levels of flourishing. Furthermore, profiles high in spirituality and character were associated with the observance of formal religion, report of high levels of spiritual and religious importance, and report of frequent attendance of religious services. DiscussionThese findings suggest that spirituality and character go hand in hand, that higher levels of the conjoint spirituality and character or "spiritually grounded character" correspond to greater wellbeing and may be generated or supported by a formal religious identification, practice, and community.},

  abstract={This study explored the validity of the Values-in-Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) in an African context. A convenience sample of 256 African students completed the VIA-IS in English. The majority of strengths subscales had good reliability coefficients and mean scores comparable to those reported in a Western context. Satisfactory criterion-related validity was established through correlations with other well-being indices. First and second order confirmatory factor analyses only partly supported construct validity. All strengths subscales consisted of more than one factor. The hypothesised six-virtue cluster pattern was partially supported. Exploratory factor analysis suggested the possibility of an emic factor pattern of strengths consisting of 3 components: Within the first factor, Intrapersonal and Relationship Strengths, two clusters are distinguished, namely, Intrapersonal Strengths, and Horizontal and Vertical Relationship Strengths. The second factor was Integrity in Group Context. Thus, the VIA-IS has merit, but is not completely valid in its original form.},

Emmons (M age=79.7 yr., SD = 2.3), which was sunk by kamikaze attacks during World War II, were given an adapted form of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian and a set of questions regarding 8 coping resources they may have used during the war. Participants were categorized into three groups: those who served on the Emmons at any given time during World War IT (Any Service), those who experienced combat while aboard the Emmons or another ship during World War II (Any Combat), and those who were serving on board the Emmons when it was sunk during the battle for Okinawa island (Okinawa). Analyses using a one-tailed Spearman rank-order correlation indicated that scores on only one coping resource, Character Strength, were significantly correlated with lower symptoms of PTSD for all three groups (Any Service: r(s) = -.46, p < .01; Any Combat:, = -.47, p < .01; Okinawa: r(s) = -.45, p < .05). The findings suggest that, for the survivors of the Emmons, psychological qualities, not social influences, were associated with a lower risk for developing PTSD.},

  abstract={Background: In light of the psychological changes in an individual suffering from chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), questions are being raised in order to understand and facilitate recovery and a return to work. This is particularly challenging for soldiers suffering from chronic PTSD, who are often young individuals suffering from moral conflicts. A French military rehabilitation program proposes the broadening of the relationships between recovery and reintegration by incorporating approaches from the field of positive psychology for soldiers with chronic PTSD. The aim of the study was to evaluate (i) the psychological resources which remain sustainable for these trauma exposed soldiers according to their PTSD symptoms, (ii) the dynamics of resource reappropriation after the military rehabilitation program, which focuses on values in action (VIA) as character strengths, and (iii) how these resources and their reappropriation facilitate civilian professional reintegration.        Method: We conducted a prospective study with 56 trauma exposed soldiers with a clinical diagnosis of chronic PTSD. PTSD severity and psychological resources (optimism, mindfulness, well-being, motivation, self-esteem, and VIA) were assessed before and after the rehabilitation program. After the identification of resource profiles, we analyzed the impact of the program on resource levels and successful reintegration into a civilian job.        Results: 3 profiles were identified based on the psychological resources of the soldiers. Profiles 1, 2, and 3 differed in terms of clinical severity (PCL5). Profile 1 exhibited both the highest level of resources and the lowest clinical severity of PTSD but did not modify its resources after the intervention program when compared to profile 3. Profile 3 was characterized by the lowest level of resources, the highest clinical severity of PTSD and the highest reappropriation in all VIAs. This profile was associated with the highest rate of reintegration success 1 year after the intervention.        Conclusions: This paper aims to broaden the relationship between recovery and reintegration by incorporating approaches from the field of positive psychology for soldiers with PTSD. VIA appears to be an important factor for reintegration. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the existing needs of the patient and the optimization of the modalities of individual, collective, and institutional rehabilitation for patients suffering from PTSD in order to better understand the dynamics of the recovery process of a chronically afflicted individual.},

  abstract={Postoperative depression is a multifaceted condition that can limit quality of life and potentially decrease the survival benefits of open heart surgery (OHS). We postulated that sex, pre-event character strengths, medical, and certain surgery indicators would predict post-event/myocardial infarction depression. To identify predictors, we collected three-wave survey data from 481 OHS patients at a large academic referral institution (age, 62+; female, 42%) and included key medical and surgical information. The final model (F[7, N = 293] = 28.15, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.408) accounted for over two fifths of the variance in post-OHS depression. Pre-event/OHS optimism mitigated post-OHS depression. Being female, older, living alone, longer surgical perfusion time, absence of left main disease greater than 50%, and pre-OHS depression were associated with the increased likelihood of post-OHS depression. Our findings suggest that teaching optimism to OHS patients might be beneficial in reducing the risk of postoperative depression and that female patients should be monitored more closely for the development of depression through an interdisciplinary approach.},

  abstract={The Encouragement Character Strength Scale (ECSS) is a self-report measure of encouragement, which refers to a tendency to enjoy and perceive oneself as being accomplished in communicating affirmations to motivate others. Although it is theoretically assumed as an overarching construct consisting of two domain-specific factors (i.e., perceived ability and enjoyment), there is inconclusive evidence regarding the most optimal factor structure of the encouragement construct. This study evaluated the factor structure, measurement invariance, and criterion-related validity of the Chinese version of the ECSS among teachers and undergraduate students in mainland China. Results showed that the bifactor model of encouragement demonstrated the best fit among undergraduate students and teachers. There was evidence supporting the measurement invariance of this factor structure across type of samples (i.e., teachers and undergraduate students) and gender. Ancillary bifactor indices indicate the superiority of using the ECSS's overall or general factor over subscale scores. The ECSS total score also showed internal consistency and temporal stability. A review of correlations between encouragement and criterion variables (i.e., kindness, hope, agreeableness, and extraversion) indicates that effect sizes ranged from moderate to large. Furthermore, the encouragement general factor was positively correlated with both psychological well-being and work engagement after controlling for the aforementioned criterion variables and demographic covariates.},

In this study, we examined differences in personal strength endorsement and associations with well-being between two distinct Israeli community samples: (1) 97 religious female youth-leaders aged 18-20; and (2) 100 secular male police investigators aged 23-50. All participants completed the Virtues in Action survey and the well-being scale of the Mental Health Inventory. Results revealed significant differences between the samples on the ratings of eight strengths, and on the strengths most highly associated with well-being.

  abstract={The data presented in this article- originally reported by Soto and colleagues (Soto et al., in press)- assess social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills, indexed by the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI), across seven independent samples (N = 6,309). Four of the datasets (N = 5000) were collected using an online survey housed on PersonalityLab.org. In two of these internet datasets, participants provided their responses to sociodemographic items, subsets of BESSI items (45 - 102 items), and the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2, 60 items). In the other two internet datasets, participants answered the same sociodemographic items and the full BESSI questionnaire (192 - 200 items). The fifth dataset was collected via an online survey sponsored by the Character Lab Research Network and included responses from 499 high school students. The High School Student Sample completed sociodemographic items, the full BESSI (192 items), and measures of academic engagement, occupational interests, peer acceptance, friendship quality, romantic relationship satisfaction, family relationship satisfaction, volunteerism, physical exercise, and life satisfaction (96 total items). The sixth dataset was collected using the Qualtrics Online Sample service, and 488 adult respondents completed an extended, observer-report version of the BESSI (284 items), sociodemographic items, and information regarding their relationship with the person whom they were reporting on (7 items). The seventh data set consisted of college students (N = 322) from Colby College. The College Student Sample completed a survey on Qualtrics that included sociodemographic items, the full BESSI (192 items), the BFI-2 (60 items), and four other SEB skill inventories (116 items). All datasets, questionnaires, and scoring forms are hosted on OSF. The data can be used to (1) understand the structure and organization of SEB skills, (2) model the relationship between SEB skills and conceptually adjacent constructs such as personality traits and character strengths, and (3) explore the associations between SEB skills and consequential outcomes.

  abstract={Background: Pathological Internet Use (PIU) has become a global issue associated with the increasing number of Internet users. Previous studies concerned both the interpersonal and intrapersonal vulnerable factors and the corresponding models. However, a limited amount of research has explored the relationship between positive factors and PIU.        Objective: The current investigation attempted to clarify the relationship between virtues and PIU among Chinese adolescents; it also sought to explore the specific contributions of the three virtues. Virtue was the core concept in positive psychology and the Values in Action Classification. A recent study demonstrated that there might be three universal virtues (relationship, vitality, and conscientiousness).        Methods: A cross-sectional sample of adolescents aged 12-17 years were recruited in 2013. A total of 674 adolescents (males = 302, females = 372; junior high school = 296, senior high school = 378) from eight junior and senior high schools in four provinces of Mainland China completed a package of psychological inventories, including the Chinese Virtues Questionnaire (CVQ) and the Adolescent Pathological Internet Use Scale (APIUS). The mean age of the current sample was 15.10 years (SD = 1.81) with an average of 5.31 years' length (SD = 2.09) of Internet use.        Results: A total of 9.50% participants exhibited significant symptoms of PIU. Male students (M (male) = 2.50) had significantly higher scores on PIU than female students (M (female) = 2.25). Relationship (beta = -.24) and conscientiousness (beta = -.21) negatively predicted PIU, whereas vitality (beta = .25) positively predicted PIU. Dominance analysis further revealed that relationship and conscientiousness could explain 81% variance of PIU, and vitality only accounted for another 19%.        Conclusions: Relationship and conscientiousness were possible protective factors of pathological Internet users, while vitality was vulnerable. The results could be helpful in screening "at-risk" Internet users (low relationship and conscientiousness as well as high vitality). Future intervention strategies could focus on how to enhance relationship and conscientiousness and on how to reduce vitality.},

  abstract={This correlational study of 346 college students examined how mindfulness (broadly construed as a manifold of self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-transcendence) is related to the three Values in Action (VIA) virtues (inquisitiveness, caring, and self-control) and to eudemonic wellbeing (personal growth, self-acceptance, purpose in life, and positive relationships). The mindfulness manifold explained between 6% and 16% of variance in virtues over and beyond the effects of the Big Five personality traits and gender. The virtue most strongly explained by mindfulness was inquisitiveness. Mindfulness and virtues had strong effects on eudemonic wellbeing; mindfulness related to most aspects of wellbeing, whereas virtues showed more specific relationships (inquisitiveness with personal growth; caring with self-acceptance and positive relationships; self-control with purpose in life and self-acceptance). All variables combined explained between 46% and 62% of the total variance in eudemonic wellbeing. There was little evidence that the virtues mediated the effects of mindfulness on eudemonic wellbeing, suggesting that mindfulness and virtue each have unique (and thus additive) contributions to eudemonic wellbeing. Mindfulness aspects most strongly associated with virtue and wellbeing were self-awareness and self-transcendence.},

  abstract={Smartphones are important communication and technological tools that have become an indispensable part of university students' lives. Although empirical research has evaluated factors that influence Smartphone addiction, few studies have explored positive and potentially protective factors such as virtues that may increase the efficacy of future Smartphone addiction prevention programs. Thus, this study examined the relationship between three key virtues (i.e., relationship, vitality, and conscientiousness) and Smartphone addiction as well as evaluated the specific contributions of these virtues as applied to Smartphone use among Chinese university students. A total of 682 undergraduates (aged 18-24 years) from three universities completed the 96-item Chinese Virtues Questionnaire and Mobile Phone Addiction Index. Results showed that three virtues were significantly correlated with Smartphone addiction. Specifically, conscientiousness and relationship virtues negatively predicted Smartphone addiction and explained 82.61% of addiction-related variance. Vitality positively predicted Smartphone addiction and accounted for the remaining 17.39% variance. Thus, this study demonstrated that conscientiousness and relationship virtues were potential protective factors for Smartphone addiction, while vitality led to increased vulnerability. Gender-related differences were also discovered. Specifically, male students may be more sensitive to the conscientiousness virtue, while female students may show increased sensitivity to the relationship virtue. Consequently, future efforts to prevent Smartphone addiction could focus on how to enhance conscientiousness and relationship virtues and how to reduce the vitality virtue.},

  abstract={The objectives of this study are to analyze the efficacy of the Virtual Hero Program during the social isolation due to COVID-19 to increase the positive emotions (joy, gratitude, serenity, personal satisfaction, and sympathy) and prosocial behavior of Colombian adolescents. Additionally, we will analyze whether the Hero program, by directly promoting positive emotional states in adolescents, can predispose them to take prosocial actions toward other people (via an indirect or mediated effect). The final sample of the study comprised 100 participants from the intervention group (M age = 13.94, SD = 0.97) and 111 from the control group (M age = 14.39, SD = 0.81). The participants were assigned to the groups using a cluster randomized trial. The positive emotions questionnaire and the Kindness and Generosity subscale of the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths were used to measure the variables. The results indicated that the program increased joy, gratitude, serenity and personal satisfaction but not sympathy of those who participated in the intervention. The promotion of these positive emotions predisposed the Colombian adolescents to act prosocially. Furthermore, the program was also effective in directly promoting prosocial behaviors in the adolescents during social isolation, as observed through a statistically significant difference in the pre- and post-test evaluations between the control and intervention groups. The structure of the intervention brought adolescents closer to social situations to which isolation had limited their access, promoting the importance of closeness and solidarity with others within the complexities of the social confinement context. This study is particularly relevant because interventions with proven effectiveness are necessary to counteract the trauma produced by social isolation in young people throughout the world.},

Participants (125 professional musicians working in various fields, 125 amateur musicians, and 125 nonmusicians) filled in the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (Peterson, Park, & Seligman, 2005), the Engagement with Beauty Scale (Diessner, Parsons, Solom, Frost, & Davidson, 2008), the Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence Test (Gusewell & Ruch, 2012a), the Sensation Seeking Scale Form V (Zuckerman, 1994), the Tellegen Absorption Scale (Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974), and the Dispositional Positive Emotion Scale (Shiota, Keltner, & John, 2006). Overall, responsiveness proved to be related to the degree of involvement in musical practice. However, professional musicians displayed distinct profiles depending on their main occupational activity: Whereas music teachers and orchestra musicians showed a specific sensitivity to artistic beauty, soloists evidenced an overall high sensitivity to all types of beauty and goodness. Furthermore, results showed that the responsiveness dimensions correlated in a theoretically meaningful manner with dispositional awe, absorption, and experience seeking.},

  abstract={Research reports that high alienation can increase smartphone addiction; however, few studies have explored potential protective factors such as virtues. Understanding virtues as protective factors may help prevent smartphone addiction and promote effective interventions. This study examined the relationship among virtues (i.e. interpersonal, vitality, and conscientiousness), alienation and smartphone addiction. Seven hundred sixteen Chinese university students (385 males, 331 females) aged 18-24years completed the 96-item Chinese Virtues Questionnaire, General Alienation Scale, and Mobile Phone Addiction Index. Results indicated that both interpersonal and conscientiousness virtues negatively predicted smartphone addiction. Alienation mediated the relationship between interpersonal and smartphone addiction, whereas conscientiousness directly affected smartphone addiction regardless of alienation level. Moreover, alienation moderated the link between conscientiousness and smartphone addiction. When students reported low alienation, those with high conscientiousness also reported lower smartphone addiction. However, there was no difference in smartphone addiction between high and low conscientiousness groups when alienation was high. This study clarified the positive role of specific virtues in reducing alienation and smartphone addiction. Future smartphone addiction intervention strategies could focus on enhancing interpersonal and conscientiousness virtues and reducing alienation. University administrators and educators should focus on improving low alienation students' conscientiousness.},

  abstract={Objective. Relationship, vitality, and conscientiousness are three fundamental virtues that have been recently identified as important individual differences to health, well being, and positive development. This cross-sectional study attempted to explore the relationship between the three constructs and post-traumatic growth (PTG) in three directions, including indirect trauma samples without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), direct trauma samples without PTSD, and direct trauma samples with PTSD.        Methods. A total of 340 community participants from Sichuan Province, Mainland China involved in the study, most of which experienced Wenchuan and Lushan Earthquake. Participants were required to complete the self-reported questionnaire packages at one time point for obtaining their scores on virtues (Chinese Virtues Questionnaire), PTSD (PTSD Checklist-Specific), and PTG (Post-traumatic Growth Inventory-Chinese).        Results. Significant and positive correlations between the three virtues and PTG were identified (r =.39-.56; p < .01). Further regression analysis by stepwise method reveled that: in the indirect trauma samples, vitality explained 32% variance of PTG. In reference to the direct trauma sample without PTSD, both relationship and conscientiousness explained 32% variance of PTG, whereas in the direct trauma sample with PTSD, only conscientiousness accounted for 31% the variance in PTG.        Conclusion. This cross-sectional investigation partly revealed the roles of different virtues in trauma context. Findings suggest important implications for strengths-based treatment.},

  abstract={Several empirical studies have linked negative parenting style (i.e., parental rejection and overprotection) with a higher degree of Smartphone addiction. However, few studies have analyzed the potential protective factors (e.g., virtues) that may prevent addiction and promote effective Smartphone addiction interventions. Therefore, we examined if virtues (i.e., relationship, vitality, and conscientiousness) mediated the association between parenting style and Smartphone addiction among college students. Moreover, we examined whether these relationships were moderated by gender. Chinese college students (N = 742) ages 16-25 years completed the: 1) short-Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran-Chinese measure of parenting style, 2) 96-item Chinese Virtues Questionnaire, and the 3) Mobile Phone Addiction Index of Smartphone addiction. The results showed that negative parenting style significantly influenced college students' Smartphone addiction. Furthermore, virtues acted as a cognitive mechanism that mediated the association between negative parenting style and Smartphone addiction. Moreover, male virtues may be more sensitive to negative parenting style than female virtues. Relevant suggestions for college administrators, educators, parents, and future researchers are offered.

  abstract={The present study aims to examine the relationship between trait resilience and virtues in the context of trauma. A total of 537 participants who attended the preliminary investigation and completed the Life Events Checklist were screened. Of these participants, 142 suffered from personal traumatic experiences in the past year; these individuals were qualified and invited to respond to online questionnaires to assess trait resilience, virtues (i.e., Conscientiousness, Vitality, and Relationship), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and post-traumatic growth (PTG). The following questionnaires were used: Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-Revised, Chinese Virtues Questionnaire, PTSD Checklist-Specific, and Post-traumatic Growth Inventory-Chinese. Only 95 participants who manifested self-reported PTSD symptoms and PTG were involved in the current analyses. Trauma was positively and significantly correlated with PTSD in the current sample. Results indicated that trait resilience was positively associated with virtues and PTG; by contrast, PTSD scores were negatively but not significantly related to most of these factors. The three virtues contributed to PTG to a greater extent than trait resilience in non-PTSD and PTSD groups. However, trait resilience remained a significant predictor in the PTSD group even when the three virtues were controlled. The relationship between trait resilience and PTG was moderated by PTSD type (non-PTSD group vs. PTSD group). Our results further suggested that trait resilience and virtues were conceptually related but functionally different constructs. Trait resilience and virtues are positively related; thus, these factors contributed variances to PTG in the context of trauma; however, trait resilience is only manifested when virtues are controlled and when individuals are diagnosed as PTSD. Furthermore, implications and limitations of this study are discussed.},
